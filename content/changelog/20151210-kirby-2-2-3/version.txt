## Panel

- Invalid files in the translation folder no longer break the translation select box.
- Fixed a bug, which broke unchecking checkboxes and always brought back the last state.
- Fixed URL validation bug. 
- Fixed history widget bug.
- Removed the strict field name check for pages. 
- Removed positive notifications after structure field updates to avoid confusion about the form already being saved.
- Updated fontawesome to 4.5
- Updated languages: Bulgarian, Indonesian, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Chinese. 

## Core

- Kirby now throws an exception if the default template cannot be found to make debugging easier.
- All unit tests now have to pass for PHP 7
- Fixed a bug in kirby/params, which broke pagination on Windows
- Fixed an issue with the uninitialized default language in the site object, for example in routes.
- Fixed field:exists
- Added configurable email options.

*Example:*
```php
// in /site/config/config.php
c::set('email.service', 'mail');
c::set('email.from', 'Bastian Allgeier <bastian@getkirby.com>');
c::set('email.replyTo', 'Bastian Allgeier <bastian@getkirby.com>');
c::set('email.subject', 'Kirby Support');

// in template, snippet or plugin
email()->send([
  'to'   => 'peter@example.com', 
  'body' => 'Hey Peter!'
])) {

```

- Moved resize and crop to the media class, so those methods can now be used everywhere (i.e. for avatars)

*Example:*
```php
<?= $site->user('peter')->avatar()->crop(128)->html() ?>
```


- Fixed a bug after a new page has been created, which didn't include it in the children list of a page yet.
- file::update and page::update now work consistently between the single-language and the multi-language version.
 
## Toolkit

- Fixed counting bug in the database query class
- Fixed PHP 7 compatibility in the database class
- Fixed a validation issue with v::url
- All unit tests have to pass in PHP 7 now
- Enabled email tag to use additional parameters without cluttering visible anchor text
- Email class configuration can now be controlled with email::$defaults
