## Highlights in 2.3.0

### New Thumb Methods

```php
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->width(300)->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->height(300)->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->resize(600, 400)->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->crop(300)->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->bw()->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->blur()->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->scale(0.5)->url();
$page->image('myimage.jpg')->ratio(3/2)->url();
```

### Better thumbnail organisation

Thumbnails are no longer stored with unrecognizable filenames in a flat structure. Each thumbnail is now store under the url path of each page and with far better readability of dimension and options: 

#### old
```
/thumbs/myimage-33BF6lAvSTlmrYLtJ184BGJ6T5657avo.jpg
```

#### new
```
/thumbs/projects/project-a/myimage-300x200.jpg
/thumbs/projects/project-a/myimage-300x200-blur.jpg
/thumbs/projects/project-a/myimage-300x200-blur-q50.jpg
```

This new structure makes it possible to delete thumbnails per page and now even the panel does that for you, whenever a page is updated or deleted.




### New Panel Image Field

### New Plugin registry
The new **(link: docs/developer-guide/plugins/registry text: plugin registry)** makes it possible to bundle all sorts of extensions into a single plugin. You can now register templates, snippets, controllers and much more in a single plugin file.

### New Component architecture
Major parts of Kirby's internal APIs are now bundled into **(link: docs/developer-guide/plugins/components text: components)**, which can be replaced and modified by you. This makes it possible to replace Kirby's template engine, the thumb API, the markdown parser and more. 

****

## Panel

- Adds the possibility to get fieldoptions from another field (e.g. a tag field) so that options can be defined dynamically.
```php 
favoritedrink:
    label: Your favorite drink
    type:  select
    options: field
    field:
      page:  ../
      name: availabledrinks
      seperator: ;
```
`page` enables to references a relative path to the page of the source field (parent page in the example). `name` is the name of the source field (`tags` by default). `seperator` lets you define the seperator the field value will be split by (default is `,`).
- Changed the order of fields in the signup form to make password first before email to avoid accidental password input into the email field

  delete: true
```

```yaml
hide: true
```
