## Important Security Update

An anonymous researcher working with (link: http://www.beyondsecurity.com/ssd.html text: Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program) has reported two vulnerabilities in Kirby 2.1.0 today. 

The first vulnerability allows to bypass panel authentication in a hosting environment where users within the same shared environment can save/read files in a directory accessible by both the victim and the attacker. 

The second issue allows authenticated users to upload normally disallowed PHP script files via the panel combined with a cross-site scripting attack. 

**Every Kirby 2 website should be updated immediately to (link: http://download.getkirby.com text: 2.1.1) to fix the vulnerabilities.**

You can find **(link: http://dev.getkirby.com/docs/installation/updates text: detailed instructions on how to update)** your current installation in our docs.
