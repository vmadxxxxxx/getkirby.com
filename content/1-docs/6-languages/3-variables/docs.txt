Description: Learn how to define translatable variables, which can be used to translate fixed parts in your templates like buttons.

Text:

When working with multi-language site projects, you often run into the problem of needing language-specific variables/strings. Simple things like translated button labels for your contact form for example or other translatable parts, which don't need to be administrated by editors.

For such a case, Kirby has a built-in language variable management.

Add the folder `/site/languages` and insert a PHP file with the specific language shortcode for each available language:

```
/site/languages/en.php
/site/languages/de.php
/site/languages/fr.php
```

Those files can contain as many custom variables as you need.

#### /site/languages/en.php

```php
<?php

l::set('submit', 'Submit');
l::set('cancel', 'Cancel');

?>
```

#### /site/languages/de.php

```php
<?php

l::set('submit', 'Abschicken');
l::set('cancel', 'Abbrechen');

?>
```

`l::set` also accepts an associative array:

```php
<?php
l::set(array(
	'submit' => 'Submit',
	'cancel' => 'Cancel',
	'next' => 'next',
	'previous' => 'previous',
));
```

Those translated variables can be used in any template, plugin or snippet:

```php
<input type="submit" value="<?php echo l::get('submit') ?>" />
```
