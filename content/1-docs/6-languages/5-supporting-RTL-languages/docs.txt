Title: Supporting RTL languages

----

Description: Learn how to support languages with a RTL (right to left) reading direction.

Text:

When supporting multiple languages you might include a language which features a different reading direction – not left-to-right (`ltr`) but right-to-left (`rtl). To support and display these languages properly some adaptions are necessary.

## Setup language

The first step is to specify the reading direction when (link: docs/languages/setup text: setting up languages). To do so, add an `direction`entry to your language array with a value of `rtl` for right-to-left or `ltr` for left-to-right (default).

```php
c::set('languages', array(
  array(
    'code'    => 'ar',
    'name'    => 'Arabic',
    'locale'  => 'ar_EG',
    'url'     => '/ar',
    'direction' => 'rtl'
  )
));
```

## Add body class

The second step is to add the reading direction as a body class e.g. in your header snippet. To get and be able to output the current language's reading direction use `$site->language()->direction()`.

```php
<body class="<?php echo $site->language()->direction() ?>">
```

## Modify your CSS

The biggest changes have to be made to your CSS. First you need to specify the reading direction for the body element when the `rtl`class is applied:

```css
body.rtl {
  direction: rtl;
}
```

Then you have to mirror every horizontal CSS layout positioning, alignment, padding, margins from left to right and from right to left, when `body.rtl`is applied:

```css
/* left to right */
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  margin-left: 2em;
  padding: 1em 3em 1em 0;
  border-right: 1px solid #eee;
}


/* right to left*/
body.rtl div {
  right: 0;
  margin-right: 2em;
  padding: 1em 0 1em 3em;
  border-left: 1px solid #eee;
}
```
