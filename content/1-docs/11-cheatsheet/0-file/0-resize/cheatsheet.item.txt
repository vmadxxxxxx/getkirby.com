Title:

$file->resize($width, $height = null, $quality = null)

----

Excerpt:

Resizes the file according to the given parameters.

----

Return:

type: object
text: Returns a Kirby media object with the given parameters

----

Text:

The new syntax is a shorthand for the old thumb() syntax. See `$file->crop()` for cropping images on the fly.

## Example

```php
// resize an image by width
$image->resize($width)->url();
// resize by width and height. The bigger one will be downscaled
$image->resize($width, $height)->url();
// adjust the jpeg compression
$image->resize($width, $height, $quality)->url();
// pass null as second argument if you only want to specify the width but also change the quality
$image->resize($width, null, $quality)->url();
```

Both methods return a Kirby media object which has tons of additional methods. So you can also do stuff like this:

```php
echo $image->resize(300)->height();

echo $image->resize(300)->niceSize();

echo $image->resize(300)->ratio();

echo $image->resize(300)->orientation();

// etc. 
```
