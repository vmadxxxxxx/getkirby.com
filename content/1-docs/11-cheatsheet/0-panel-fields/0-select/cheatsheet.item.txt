Title: Select

----

Excerpt:

A simple selectbox field

----

Text:

The select field displays any number of options in a dropdown selectbox. This is perfect if you have lots of options, from which the user can just choose one.

## Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```

### Example with a single default value

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    default: architecture
    options:
      design: Design
      architecture: Architecture
      photography: Photography
      3d: 3D
      web: Web
```

### Dynamic options

Instead of defining options yourself, you can use an array of predefined dynamic ways to provide options:

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    default: architecture
    options: children
```

#### Available option keywords

Option | Description 
- | -
children | List of options with all children
visibleChildren | List of options with all visible children
invisibleChildren | List of options with all invisible children
visibleSiblings | List of options with all visible siblings
invisibleSiblings | List of options with all invisible siblings
pages | List of options with all pages of the site
siblings | List of options with all siblings
files | List of options with all files of the page
images | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: images) of the page 
documents | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: documents) of the page
videos | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: videos) of the page
audio | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: audio files) of the page
code | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: code files) of the page
archives | List of options with all (link: docs/cheatsheet/file/type text: archives) of the page


### Option queries

An even more powerful way of generating dynamic options is the query option:

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    default: architecture
    options: query
    query: 
      page: downloads
      fetch: files
      value: '{{filename}}'
      text: '{{filename}}'
      flip: true
```

#### Query Options

Option | Default | Description
- | - 
page | current page | Any page URI. This is a powerful way to fetch any kind of data from any other page. You can even use relative paths to step up levels in the hirarchy. For example: ../../ to go two levels up or / to get to the top level.
fetch | children | See the list above for possible options
value | {{uid}} | A string to be used for the value attribute. You can use {{varname}} for any object method from the passed object (page or file)
text | {{title}} | A string to be used for the displayed option text. You can use {{varname}} for any object method from the passed object (page or file)
flip | false | If true, the list of options will be reversed
template | false | A template name that will filter out all items with a different intended template

### Dynamic options via JSON API

Sometimes you need more control to fetch information from external sources. You can achieve this by providing a valid URL to an API, which returns a JSON object with keys and values for the select field

#### Example

```
fields:
  category:
    label: Category
    type: select
    default: architecture
    options: http://example.com/api/categories.json
```

The json must be have the following format: 

```
{
  "design": "Design",
  "architecture": "Architecture",
  "photography": "Photography",
  "3d": "3D",
  "web": "Web"
}
```
