## Intro

****

**Note**: This tutorial makes use of the (link: docs/developer-guide/advanced/representations text: content representations) feature introduced in Kirby 2.4. With a few changes, you can also make this work in older versions of Kirby.

This tutorial assumes that you have a page called `projects` in `/content` with some project subpages. For the example to work, the text file in `/projects` must be called `projects.txt`.

**Do not put the HTML comment tags `<!-- This is a comment -->` in the code examples below into your files, they are just there to indicate file names.**

****

Often, you only want to show a limited number of projects, articles or images on a page when it is first loaded. If users want to see more, they can click or tap a button and additional content is appended to the DOM. In this tutorial, we'll go through the steps that are needed to achieve this with Kirby.

Here's a quick wrap-up of what we'll be doing:

We start with a projects page where we display a limited number of projects with their image and title. When the user clicks a "load more" button, our JavaScript event listener makes an Ajax call to the JSON representation of our template. If the call is successful, the content is appended to the page.


## The standard template

Let's start with the `projects.php` template.

```php
<!-- /site/templates/projects.php -->
<?php snippet('header') ?>

  <main class="main" role="main">
    <h1><?= $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
    <?= $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>

    <ul class="projects" data-page="<?= $page->url() ?>" data-limit="<?= $limit ?>">

      <!-- Loop through the projects -->
      <?php foreach($projects as $project): ?>
        <?php snippet('project', compact('project')) ?>
      <?php endforeach ?>

    </ul>
    <button class="load-more">Load more</button>

  </main>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

We put the list item for each project in a separate snippet. We'll need that a second time and can avoid to write redundant code that way.

```php
<!-- /site/snippets/project.php -->
<li class="project">
  <a href="<?= $project->url() ?>" class="project-link">
    <!-- We want to get the first image of each project. We first check if it exists! -->
    <?php if($image = $project->image()): ?>
    <img src="<?= $image->url() ?>" alt="<?= $image->alt_text()->html() ?>" />
    <?php endif ?>
    <div class="project-caption">
      <h2 class="project-title"><?= $project->title()->html() ?></h2>
    </div>
  </a>
</li>
```


Apart from our HTML for the project, we have included a button with the class `load-more`. Also, we added two data attributes `data-page` and `data-limit` to pass the current page and the limit value to our JavaScript code.

You will probably have noticed that we haven't defined the variable `$projects` yet, so PHP would issue a warning if we tried to load the page. We'll catch up on this now in our `projects.php` controller.

## The controller

The controller is the place where we add our template logic:

```php
<!-- /site/controllers/projects.php -->
<?php

return function($site, $pages, $page) {

  $projects = $page->children()->visible();
  $count    = $projects->count();

  // check if the request is an Ajax request and if the limit and offset keys are set
  if(r::ajax() && get('offset') && get('limit')) {

    // convert limit and offset values to integer
    $offset = intval(get('offset'));
    $limit  = intval(get('limit'));

    // limit projects using offset and limit values
    $projects = $projects->offset($offset)->limit($limit);

    // check if there are more projects left
    $more = $count > $offset + 1;

  // otherwise set the number of projects initially displayed
  } else {

    $offset   = 0;
    $limit    = 2;
    $projects = $projects->limit($limit);

  }

  return compact('offset', 'limit', 'projects', 'more');

};
```

First, we fetch all visible children of the `projects` page and store it in the `$projects` variable. We also store the number of subpages in `$count`.

Then we check if the request is an Ajax request, and if the request contains the `offset` and `limit` keys:

```php
if(r::ajax() && get('offset') && get('limit')) {

// ...

} else {

  $offset   = 0;
  $limit    = 2;
  $projects = $projects->limit($limit);
}
```

If the request is not an Ajax request, we set the `$offset` and `$limit` variables and limit the number of projects to be displayed on first page load.

If the request is an Ajax request, the code within the braces is executed:

```php
// convert limit and offset values to integer
$offset = intval(get('offset'));
$limit  = intval(get('limit'));

// limit projects using offset and limit values
$projects = $projects->offset($offset)->limit($limit);

// check if there are more projects left
$more = $count > $offset+1;
```

We first convert the values for `offset` and `limit` to integer. Then we apply those values to the `offset()` and `limit()` methods we call on `$projects`. In the last step, we check if the number of projects is still greater than the value of `$offset` plus 1 and depending on the result, we set `$more` to `true` or `false`.

At the end of the controller, we return all variables so that they can be used by the template(s).

## The JSON template

Now we create a second, content specific template for the JSON representation: `projects.json.php`. Let's take a look at the file:

```php
<!-- /site/templates/projects.json.php -->
<?php

$html = '';

foreach($projects as $project) {

  // reuse the project snippet to create the HTML for each project
  // we need to set the third parameter to true, to return the
  // snippet content instead of echoing it
  $html .= snippet('project', compact('project'), true);

}

// add $html and $more to the $data array
$data['html'] = $html;
$data['more'] = $more;

// JSON encode the $data array
echo json_encode($data);
```

With this template set up, we can now make a call to `http://example.com/projects.json` in our Javascript code and the template will echo the JSON encoded data. But let's go through this in a little bit more detail.

First, we define a variable `$html` as an empty string. We then loop through the projects returned from the controller and add the HTML/PHP code for each project to the `$html` variable.

Next, the `$html` and `$more` variables are added to the `$data` array. And finally, we `json_encode()` the `$data` array, so that the data can be handled by our JavaScript code.

## The JavaScript

To make our example work, we now have to create the JavaScript code (jQuery in this case).

```javascript
// assets/js/script.js
$(function(){

  var element = $('.projects');
  var url     = element.data('page') + '.json';
  var limit   = parseInt(element.data('limit'));
  var offset  = limit;

  $('.load-more').on('click', function(e) {

    $.get(url, {limit: limit, offset: offset}, function(data) {

      if(data.more === false) {
        $('.load-more').hide();
      }

      element.children().last().after(data.html);

      offset += limit;

    });

  });

});
```

Let's go through this step by step:

1. We define a couple of variables that we will need later in the code.

    ```javascript
    var element = $('.projects');
    var url     = element.data('page') + '.json';
    var limit   = parseInt(element.data('limit'));
    var offset  = limit;
    ```

    We get the `limit` and the base part of the `url` variables from the data attributes we defined in the `projects.php` template above. Note that we add the `json` suffix to the URL, so that our JSON content representation will be fetched instead of the standard template.

2. We add the event listener, which is triggered when the `load-more` button is clicked.

    ```javascript
    $('.load-more').on('click', function(e) {

    });
    ```

3. The function contains the Ajax call:

    ```javascript
    $.get(url, {limit: limit, offset: offset}, function(data) {

      if(data.more === false) {
        $('.load-more').hide();
      }

      element.children().last().after(data.html);

      offset += limit;

    });

    ```

    With the Ajax request, we send the values for limit and offset to the `project.php` controller. If the GET request was successful, we append the HTML to the last child element of the `.projects` container:

    ```javascript
    element.children().last().after(data.html);
    ```

    We hide the button if there are no more projects left:

    ```javascript
    if(data.more === false) {
      $('.load-more').hide();
    }
    ```

    Finally, we increase the `offset` by the value of `limit`.

    ```javascript
    offset += limit;
    ```

We are almost there. Now let's not forget to add jQuery and our script file to our footer.

## Include JavaScript in footer

```php
<!-- /site/snippets/footer.php -->
<?php
  echo js([
    'assets/js/jquery.min.js',
    'assets/js/script.js'
  ]);
?>
```
Note that we include a local copy of jQuery in this example. As an alternative, you can load it from a CDN. Or rewrite to code to use vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery, of course.

## If Javascript is not available…

Depending on your use case, you may want to either hide the button if JavaScript is not available, or provide a fallback with a link to the complete list of projects.
