We are using a platform called (link: https://www.transifex.com/getkirby/panel/ text: Transifex) to translate the Kirby Panel interface. It's a fantastic collaborative tool, which makes it easy for a group of translators to work on translations in different languages at the same time and keep them up to date quickly. 

## Everyone can become a translator! 

All you need to do is to sign up on our Transifex page: 
**<https://www.transifex.com/getkirby/panel/>**

We will accept new translators as quickly as possible. Afterwards you can instantly get started and help improve translations or contribute new ones for missing languages. 

See you on Transifex!
