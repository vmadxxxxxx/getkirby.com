## Options

With the options setting, you can switch off and on all major features for a page in the panel. This can be useful to block certain functionalities for editors, based on the blueprint/template.

### Available options

| Settings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Preview | Show/hide the preview button in the sidebar |
| Status | Allow/disallow to change the status of a page to visible/invisible |
| Template | Allow/disallow to change the template of a page, when possible |
| URL | Allow/disallow to modify the URL of a page |
| Delete | Allow/disallow to delete a page |

In your blueprint you can set options like this:

```
title: My blueprint
pages: true
files: true
options:
  preview: true
  status: false
  template: true
  url: true
  delete: false
fields:
  …
```

If you set the `template` option to true, panel users can only change templates if the (link: docs/panel/blueprints/subpages-settings text: page settings of the parent blueprint) allow at least two templates.

</since>

### Prevent editing

Use the `update` option to prevent editing of a page for all editors via a blueprint setting. If you want to prevent editing of a page based on user role, check out (link: docs/panel/permissions text: permissions). Note that with this option set to `false`, it is still possible to change the visibility of a page unless you set `status: false`as well.

```
title: My blueprint
pages: true
files: true
options:
  update: false
fields:
  …
```
</since>

## Page preview

The sidebar for each page contains a link, which will take panel users to the corresponding page. Sometimes it makes sense to reroute this link or hide it entirely.

### Rerouting the preview link

In Kirby it's often useful to add subpages as data providers instead of real pages. A typical example would be a one-pager with subpages for each section or a contact page with multiple addresses, which are fed by subpages. In such a case the preview link should lead to the parent page and not to the subpage.

For scenarios like this you have three available options to reroute the preview link:

| Settings | Description | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parent | The preview link will lead to the parent page. |`preview: parent` |
| First child | The preview link will lead to the first subpage of the current page. | `preview: first-child`|
| Last child | The preview link will lead to the last subpage of the current page. | `preview: last-child` |


### Hiding the preview link

The preview link can also be switched off entirely. In this case it will not be shown in the sidebar at all.

```
…
preview: false
…
```

## Prevent page deletion

By default pages can be deleted in the panel. In some cases you may want to protect important pages from deletion.

This setting will prevent panel users from deleting pages that use this blueprint:

```
…
deletable: false
…
```

Even when deleting is enabled, a page with subpages cannot be deleted. You have to delete its subpages first.

## Hide page

Since Kirby 2.3.0 you can hide a page from the panel:

```
…
hide: true
…
```
</since>

## Set custom icon

You can set a custom icon for pages that will be shown in the sidebar. You can reference all Fontawesome icons by their name without "fa-".

```
…
icon: suitcase
…
```
