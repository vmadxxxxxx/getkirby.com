Title: How to publish your plugin

----

Text:

There are two places, where you can publish your plugin. 

## Add a readme

Make sure to add a useful readme with instructions to your plugin. 

## Put it on Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab

We highly recommend, that you put it in a public git repository, so other developers can clone, update it or even contribute to it.

## License

We don't require any specific license for plugins. Go for whatever works best for you. 

## Tell others about it
