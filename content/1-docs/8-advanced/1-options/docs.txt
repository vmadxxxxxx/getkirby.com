Text:

All available options can be set in your config file in `/site/config` like this:

```php
c::set('option', 'value');
```

There are a number of available options in Kirby, which help you to customize the system just the way you want it. Check out the (link: docs/cheatsheet#options text: full list of options) in the cheat sheet. 

## Your own options

If you need a simple way to store options throughout the system and access them in any plugin, template or snippet, you can define your own options in the same way:

```php
c::set('yourOption', 'yourValue');
```

You can fetch your options later with…

```php
echo c::get('yourOption')
// will output 'yourValue'
```

If you want to make sure to get a proper default value if the option is not set you can define a fallback:

```php
echo c::get('undefinedOption', 'fallbackValue')
// will output 'fallbackValue' if undefinedOption is undefined
```

## Multi-environment setup

Kirby has a built-in way to set different options based on the domain by adding additional config files containing the domain.

### Example setup

```
/site/config/config.localhost.php
/site/config/config.staging.yourdomain.com.php
/site/config/config.yourdomain.com.php
```

By setting different options in those config files you get a very flexible system, which can be deployed to different servers and react to the current environment accordingly.
