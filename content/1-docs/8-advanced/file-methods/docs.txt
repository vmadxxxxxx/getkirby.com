## Default file methods

**For a full (link: docs/cheatsheet/#file text: list of default file methods), please check out the cheat sheet.** Be aware that you cannot override these default file methods with any custom file method.

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined file methods very easily. The best place to do this is in a plugin file: `/site/plugins/file-methods.php`

```php
file::$methods['soShiny'] = function($file) {
  return 'Everything so shiny: <a href="' . $file->url() . '">' . $file->filename() . '</a>';
};
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a file method. You define the method name with the key for the `file::$methods` array. The callback function receives the `$file` object as first argument.

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?php echo $file->soSomething('shiny') ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very simple:

```php
file::$methods['soSomething'] = function($file, $adjective) {
    return 'Everything so ' . $adjective . ': <a href="' . $file->url() . '">' . $file->filename() . '</a>';
};
```
