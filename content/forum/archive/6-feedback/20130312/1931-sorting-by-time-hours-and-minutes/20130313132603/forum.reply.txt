Text: I think you would need to create a new or extra field for panel which is maybe based upon the current one but stored a time and date. 

Although slightly against the Kirby text idea, perhaps a UNIX date/time stamp format? 

Also if you format the date like:
`yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 
 2013-03-13 12:25:00
`
It would aid sorting?
