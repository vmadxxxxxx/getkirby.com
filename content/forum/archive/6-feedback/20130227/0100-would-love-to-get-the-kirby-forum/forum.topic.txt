Text: Hey,

I've been trying to get the most simple forum to use with my site and found this http://http://camendesign.com/code/nononsense_forum witch is great but would rather get the kirby forum version. 

Even if there are glitches and it's still in beta I'd still would love to get it ;)

cheers
