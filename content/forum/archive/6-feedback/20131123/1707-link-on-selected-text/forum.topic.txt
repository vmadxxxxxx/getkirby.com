Text: Guys i love Kirby!

By the way this is just a suggestion.

It would be nice to select a text string in a textarea and then, when you click on the "link" button, to find that text in the "link text" field without having to write it again.

It's a small enhancement but it could help some inexpert users.

Can't wait to see what kirby 2 will bring. Thanks.
