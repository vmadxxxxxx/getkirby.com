Text: Hey Nils, 

I totally agree. Setting the permissions is tedious. I'm working on improving that. 

In Finder you can open the context window for your content folder with CMD-i and then set permissions to "Read & Write" for all three groups and apply that to enclosed items. 

I feel bad for linking to that here, but Wordpress has an excellent write up about how to change permissions for folders and files: 
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions> which might help you to change settings on your server. Sometimes 0755 or 0666 is not working and I need to change that in the panel asap. 

As you know it is still a beta and though the panel is pretty stable in all editor parts, the setup is still very much improvable. 

I hope this helps though.
