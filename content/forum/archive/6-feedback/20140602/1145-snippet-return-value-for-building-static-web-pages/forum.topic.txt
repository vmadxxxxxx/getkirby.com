Text: I was trying to build static web pages using Kirby. For this I would find it convenient, to return a value from a template snippet. This way I could include $html = snippet('myMenu') into home.php and save that to a static file.

Can anyone give me a hint for building static webpages using Kirby? I hoped, this would be simple using Kirby's own template system and not being forced to use "ob_start();eval( '?>' . $code );" or DomDocument or phpquery on top of it.

P.S.: "ob_start();eval( '?>' . $code );" is used in https://github.com/catnapgames/Tempo/blob/master/tempo.php
