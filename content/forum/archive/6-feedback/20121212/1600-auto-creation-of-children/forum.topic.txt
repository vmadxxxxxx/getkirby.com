Text: I wish I could setup the panel to auto-create a set of children pages when I add a particular new page template.

So for instance, if I add a new project, when I create that project page in the panel, I wish it automatically added Page A, Page B, Page C as children.

Maybe it could be similar to the way we currently define what template the children can be in a blueprint, we could also toggle an auto-creation or something...
