Text: Although you cannot use it with Panel, I use a snippet which contains all the code for all the social media links/icons and other links I might need and then I call them from templates specifying what I need and in what format. It is just an array of links (linksList).

I can call a variety of items, formatted as 'list', 'paragraph', 'button', 'span' or just links.

```php
snippet('linksList',
	array(
	'showLinksFor'=>'skype,linkedin,vcard,tweet',
	'format=>'list', 
	'class'=>'class'
	     )
       )
```
You can (and I do) even put the actual stuff like Skype address in the site.txt ;-)
