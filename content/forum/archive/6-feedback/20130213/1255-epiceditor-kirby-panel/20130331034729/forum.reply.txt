I don’t know whether you know (link:http://iawriter.com text:iA Writer), it’s yet another markdown app. It doesn’t do very much, but some simple things like immediately *highlighting* text.
I really liked this and found (link:http://codemirror.net text:Codemirror), a syntax highlighting script that supports markdown, too.

It required some hacking, but it works. It would be great if you could just add files into the panel-folder which would be auto-loaded so you don’t need to make any changes to the existing code.
