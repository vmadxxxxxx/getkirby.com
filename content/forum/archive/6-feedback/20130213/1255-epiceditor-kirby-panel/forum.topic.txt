Text: A few mounts ago we have some discussions (link:http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:160 text: this) and (link:http://getkirby.com/forum/panel/topic:80 text:this too), about text editor in Panel.

One of our ideas is to have (link:http://mouapp.com text:Mou popup: yes) like editor with live preview of your markdown, so recently i discovered (link:http://oscargodson.github.com/EpicEditor/ text:EpicEditor popup: yes) that offer exactly what does Mou.

**UPDATE 1:**
I mark "solved" this topic cause currently EpicEditor doesn't support mobile devices.
