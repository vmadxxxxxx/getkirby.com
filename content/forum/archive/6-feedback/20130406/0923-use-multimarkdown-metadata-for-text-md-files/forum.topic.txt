Text: It would be a great idea if Kirby used the more standard [MultiMarkdown Metadata](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide) structure rather than the current unique style. 

**Current**
```css
Title: Your Title

----

Date : 2013/04/06

----

Text: Your text

```
**MultiMarkdown**
```css
Title: Your Title
Date : 2013/04/06

Your text
```

It would more closely tie in with the YAML in Blueprints and would mean you could just put a MultiMarkdown file in a folder and it would work ;-)
