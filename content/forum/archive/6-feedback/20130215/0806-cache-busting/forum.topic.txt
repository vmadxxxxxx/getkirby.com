Text: It would be nice if the next version of Kirby can have the option of this cache busting.

Problem: How to cache bust when a user has downloaded your assets and you have set a far future time in your .htaccess?

If you change stuff, maybe some CSS or JS it might not be updated.

However, there seems to be a simple cache busting technique in the [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.1.0/doc/htaccess.md)

It suggests just by adding say a timestamp (for example) to your asset file link, coupled with a bit of .htaccess magic, you can bust the cache and serve updated files. 

You do not have to rename the resource on the filesystem. All you have to do is add the timestamp number to the filename in your HTML source/PHP code and the modified .htaccess directive will serve up the proper file. 

So if you update the file and have this system use the timestamp, it will change ;-) 

It could of course be used for all assets, JS, CSS, Images etc.

It all looks pretty good to me...although I have not tried it with Kirby CMS yet.
