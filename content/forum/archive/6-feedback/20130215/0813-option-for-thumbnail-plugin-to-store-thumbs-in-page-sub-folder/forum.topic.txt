Text: It would be nice for the Thumbnail Plugin to have the option to store the thumbnail images in a sub folder of the page, rather than a central thumbs directory. 

```html
page
    page.txt
    image1.jpg
    image2.jpg
    thumbs
        0d419e4cd2cc58525a494cf7befb0a80.200.200.false.1.75.jpg

```

It has caused some problems for us with sites with many generated thumbnails, when we remove a page we have to remove the whole 'thumbs' folder and re-visit the page to re-populate the thumbs images cache. Otherwise we end up with an ever expanding and maybe getting slower, thumbs cache? 

p.s. Some nicer thumb naming would be cool and perhaps [cache busting?](http://getkirby.com/forum/feedback/topic:400)
