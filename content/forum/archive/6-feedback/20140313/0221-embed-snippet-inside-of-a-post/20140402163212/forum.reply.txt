Text: My guess is it's something related to the way the snippets function works. I think you'd have to find a way to load the snippet file into a string instead of using the actual snippet function.

In fact, I just tested with this code and it worked. I did `        $this->addTags('snippet');` and called it by `(snippet: customer-quote)` and then the function looks like this:

```php
function snippet($params) {
    $html = file_get_contents($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . '/site/snippets/' . $params['snippet'] . '.php');
    return $html;
}
```
