Text: The below mentioned has worked for me

php foreach($pages as $page):
php $postDate = strtotime($page->date());
			$todaysDate = time() - (time() % 86400);
				if ( $postDate >= $todaysDate) : 

<//here your html>

php endif ?> 
php endforeach ?>

When you want to show 3 articles/upcoming events, you have to put your limit +1, so in your case at 4

Sorry, but I still don't understand to right markup for code... shame on me!


EDIT:

or shorter:
//php if ($page->date() >= strtotime(date('d.m.Y'))): ?>
<//here your html>
php endif ?>
