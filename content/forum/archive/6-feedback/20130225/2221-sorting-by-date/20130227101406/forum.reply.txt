Text: I think this is more a general topic than a suggestion, but nevertheless, have a look at the `sortBy()` and the `limit()` methods: <http://getkirby.com/docs/variables/pages>

Your code for catching the events could be:
```php
$pages->find("veranstaltungen")->children()->visible()->sortBy("date", "desc")->limit(3)
```
