Text: It's very useful to have a notice when you login to Panel that someone else has done login too. Maybe visualise user data from `site/panel/accounts/user.php` ex. name and email.

Maybe some connection with (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/fields/author text: Kirby Panel Author field).
