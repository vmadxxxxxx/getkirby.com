Text: For me, (link:https://disqus.com text:Disqus) works perfectly as an easy-to-use comment system. Commenting should definitely not be native to Kirby, as it really takes away from the whole idea of it being lightweight. I could see it as a plugin, but I still think something like Disqus or LiveFyre is a much better option.

PS. Disqus hits pretty much every one of OP's requirements.
