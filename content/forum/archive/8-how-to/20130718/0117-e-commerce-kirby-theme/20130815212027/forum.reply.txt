Text: Were you able to find a way to integrate an inventory system?

I've been building up a site for a client and we're about to launch - with paypal at first, but once their API is updated with more features, Shoplocket is seeming like a good bet for something that's easy to integrate and also to maintain on the client's end.

Looking forward to seeing your work, Chris ~
