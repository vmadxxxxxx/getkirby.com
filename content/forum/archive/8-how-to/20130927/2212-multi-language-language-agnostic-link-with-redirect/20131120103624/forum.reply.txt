Text: Hi All

Okay, I've built a modified version of Kirby that does what I needed.

This boils down to:

- the default language code is hidden form the URL (example.com/page)
- the other language codes show in the URL (example.com/de/page)
- unknown pages or unknown languages codes result in a 404 not a redirect

It would be great if you guys could try this out and let me know what you think/how you get on with it.

I've checked it with an out of the box Kirby install and it seems to be working.

Please do NOT use this in production - it has not been extensively tested!

That said the modification are very small!
