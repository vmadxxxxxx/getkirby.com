Text: This is the latest website I built with Kirby, and by far the most complex/challenging/filled with dirty hacks : __<http://360in365.com/archive/>__. Sorry if you don't read French, it's about my travels around the world.

Today I'd like to share the way I built the calendar on the right-hand side of the navigation pane :

Why do I share it? Because you might have a better, leaner, simpler solution. I'm far from being a PHP guru, but I know the difference between a dirty hack and an elegant solution — mine is a dirty hack. I gotta add, I love Kirby, and this is not a piece to badmouth Bastian and its creations. I'm just relaying how I got around limitations, and opening the discussion so you can tell me what I did right and what's reaaaaaally wrong in my solution.

It all had to do with Date manipulation. I didn't find an easy way to manipulate dates, as I would have in WordPress, but Kirby isn't meant as a blogging tool — even if it's often used as one.

My website is an archive : I want to be able to navigate by day, or by month.

Sadly, I couldn't do a request like this, that would get me all the children of the page named `day`, that are dated from April 2010 :

    $pages()->find("day")->children()->$filterBy($date,{month: 2010-03})

So I had to improvise. Here is my folder list :

    /
        /01-day/
            /01-day1/
            /02-day2/
            /03-day3/
            /04-day4/
        /02-month/
            /01-2010-march/
            /02-2010-april/

Each `day` has a day.txt formated like this :

    Title: Day 1
    ----
    Datetxt: 26, March 2010
    ----
    Content: […]

and each `month` had a month.txt formated like that :

    Title: March 2010
    ----
    Id: March 2010, 31
    ----
    Content: 

So my `month.php` template fetches all the days this way :

    $month_name = substr($page->id(), 0, -4);
    $results = $pages->find('day')
                      ->children()
                      ->visible()
                      ->filterBy('datetxt', $month_name, ',')
                      ->paginate(31);

The calendar part is a little messier, as you can see for yourself :

    <?php
        $monthsList = $pages->find('month')->children()->visible();
        foreach($monthsList as $month):
    ?>
    <li class="month"><a href="<?php echo $month->url() ?>"><?php echo $month->title() ?></a>
        <ul>
    <?php
        $monthDuration = substr($month->id(), -2, 2);
        for ($day=1; $day <= $monthDuration; $day++):
            // constructing the full day name
            if($day == 1):
                // 1st day of a month is written "1er" (in French)
                $fullDayName = strtolower($day . "<sup>er</sup>, " . $month->title());
            else:
                // all the other days are the same, thankfully
                $fullDayName = strtolower($day . ", " . $month->title());
            endif;
            // fetching the $dayObject by $fullDayName
            if ($dayObject = $pages->find('jour')->children()->findBy('datetxt', $fullDayName)):
    ?>
            <li><a href="<?php echo $dayObject->url() ?>"><?php echo $day ?></a></li>
            <?php else: ?>
            <li><a class="inactive"><?php echo $day ?></a></li>
            <?php endif ?>
         <?php endfor ?>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <? endforeach ?>

So yeah. For each day I construct a full date, try to find it, and link to it if it exists. You'll notice that `$monthDuration` is the number of days, and it's the second part of `$id` in `month` pages. 28 for Feb., 31 for March, 30 for April…

So yeah, here's my dirty hack for all to see. How would you have done it in a more elegant way? Is there a better, more legit way of handling dates, in the Kirby core?
