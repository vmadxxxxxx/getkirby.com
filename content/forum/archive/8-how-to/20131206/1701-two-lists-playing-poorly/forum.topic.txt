I'm just getting into Kirby and back into some PHP, so excuse my ignorance here. I'm sure my flub is obvious to most.

What I'm trying to do:
I'm building a "one pager" of sorts. A homepage that will display my most recent blog post, with an index / list of other posts below. So that's the first list.

Below that will be a list of talks I've given. 

Both lists will link off to a corresponding detail page.

What's occurring:
The two lists seem to be intermingling. They're displaying as separate lists on the page, but the data from each list are essentially combining in the two instances they're rendered. 

Here's a screenshot where you can see some of the duplication...

Here's the code from the blog.php snippet:

    <section id="blogs">
    	    <div class="section row">
		    <div class="container">
			    <div class="col twelve">
			    <h3><?php echo html($data->title()) ?></h3>			
			    <div class="article-listings">
			     <ul>
			     <?php foreach($pages->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>
			      <li>
			        <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><?php echo html($article->title()) ?> <span class="article-date">&mdash; <?php echo html($article->date('m.d.Y')) ?></span></a> 
			      </li>
			      <?php endforeach ?>
			     </ul>
			    </div>
			    </div>
		    </div>
	    </div>
    </section>

This is the code for my talks.php snippet:

    <section id="talks">
 	    <div class="section row">
		    <div class="container">
			    <div class="col twelve">
			     <h3><?php echo html($data->title()) ?></h3>
			     <?php echo kirbytext($data->text()) ?>
			
			    <div class="talk-listings">
			     <ul>
				    <?php foreach($pages->children()->visible()->flip() as $talk): ?>
			      <li>
			        <a href="<?php echo $talk->url() ?>"><?php echo html($talk->event()) ?></a> 
			      </li>
			      <?php endforeach ?>
			     </ul>
			    </div>
			    </div>
		    </div>
	    </div>
    </section>

What the heck am I doing wrong? :)

Thanks!
