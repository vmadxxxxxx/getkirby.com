Text: Made a reply on one of the topics in Forums > General. Seems off tangent from what was being discussed so I'm posting this here for those who may find this useful. This is my approach to **category template**:

I just made a demo for a catalog type site using kirby. Products are grouped in categories. Each category has its own page. Here's the [working site](http://tertoncraft.com/products), the links for the categories are on the left.

This is the folder structure:

	01-products
	-- 01-product1
	---- product-detail.txt
	-- 02-product2
	---- product-detail.txt
	-- 03-product3
	---- product-detail.txt
	[...]
	-- category1
	---- category.txt
	-- category2
	---- category.txt
	-- category3
	---- category.txt

What I did was have `categories` as _invisible siblings_ of the products. So there's one **product** folder where all products are placed including the _invisible_ categories. A category folder has a text file named category.txt which only contains **title: _categoryname_**. The actual products have a text field on the **product-detail.txt** for _category_. Finally, the category.php template has this:

    <?php $myValue = $page->title(); $myText = (string)$myValue; ?>
    
	<div class="prodBox">
        <?php $allProds = $page->siblings()->visible()->filterBy('category',$myText); ?>
        <?php foreach($allProds as $allProd): ?>   
          <div class="imgbox">
            <a href="<?php echo $allProd->url() ?>">
              <img src="<?php echo thumb($allProd->images()->first(), array('width' => 340, 'crop' => true), false) ?>">
              <span><?php echo $allProd->title() ?></span>
            </a>
          </div>
		<?php endforeach ?>
    </div>

So when adding a new category, the user can just make a new category subpage and keep it invisible. 

Note that I had to make `$myValue` to string to make it work. I'm sure there's a better way, I'm a newbie to php :D
