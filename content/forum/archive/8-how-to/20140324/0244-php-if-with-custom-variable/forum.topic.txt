Text: Hi, I am trying to build a php if to check if there is text in the variable. Otherwise, I would like to hide the complete div, so that there is not the Client text without any actual client.

Here’s what I got so far. true is not working, and I did not found any way of doing this in the cheatsheet

    <?php if($page->client()->TRUE): ?>
      <div class="six columns omega">
        <p>Client</p>
        <?php echo $page->client() ?>
      </div>
    <?php endif ?>
