Text: Is it possible to add links to images that will lead to other websites?

I want to make it possible to add link to the images together with title and caption in text file:

Title: Chatroulette – Connected, feel free to talk now
Caption: Chatroulette – Connected, feel free to talk now                                           
Link: www.chatroulette.com
 
 

I have added this code to page template:

 `<ul class="content">
<?php foreach($page->images() as $img): ?>
<li>
<figure> 
<a href="<?php echo $img->link() ?>"><img src="<?php echo $img->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $img->title() ?>" /></a>
<figcaption><?php echo $img->caption() ?></figcaption>
</figure> 
 </li>
<?php endforeach ?> 
</ul>`    

But the link I get is http://mywebsite.com/www.chatroulette.com

Can anyone help?
