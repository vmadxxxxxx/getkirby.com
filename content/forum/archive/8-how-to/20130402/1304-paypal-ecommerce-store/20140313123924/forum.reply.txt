Text: Hello guys, before all thanks for this best flat-file CMS, I thinking to use for my clients, for a moment I wanna testing in local before use in production.

After this the problem for product title is very simple and you have two options:

1. Use `htmlspecialchars` for convert quote to html code.
2. Use `addslashes` to add a slash.

For a moment I can't try because I working on refactoring this cart plugin with a class and calling some code with static functions (_I don't like use some php code inside templates files_ :P) but if you wanna try and you need a support you can ask here, I really happy to help you ^_^
