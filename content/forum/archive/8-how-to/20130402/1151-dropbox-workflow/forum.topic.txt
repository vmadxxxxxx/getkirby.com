Text: # The Development Setup of my Dreams

It's based on a dropbox folder syncing the content between my local dev environment, my customer and the server:

### Setting it up
The tutorial [kirby meets dropbox](http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-meets-dropbox) and more specifically [this tutorial (german)](http://maxhaesslein.de/blog/webentwicklung/1329055694) for uberspace users by Max Häßlein helped me get the server-side dropbox client running.

### Errors
Running `~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd` didn't print the URL to link my Dropbox folder. I had to run the command as a cron-job and then read out the link from the log (daemontools was quite helpfull there).

### Linking the Dropbox locally
Way to often I had to see kirby telling me the following:
![kirby content directory could not be found](http://f.cl.ly/items/1T3l3Y311L1C0w1K2Z1p/kirby-content-directory-not-found.png)
Somehow kirby wasn't able to access the dropbox directory I placed into the folder as a symlink. Eventually I found the error: naturally, the Dropbox directory's access rules are very restrictive. Only the local user is allowed to access it (`700`). I set the Dropbox access rights to `755` (`chmod 755 ~/Dropbox` via terminal) and – boom – it worked. 

### Synching the Code
I sync my local kirby environment with the server using **git**. [This tutorial](http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto) was very helpful - it describes how to use the git post-receive hook to checkout the code on the server.
