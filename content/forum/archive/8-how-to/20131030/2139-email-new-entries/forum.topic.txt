Text: Basically I'm trying to setup a local system that will automatically email new entries to evernote.

I want the title of the email to be

the entry title ="Some Title"
plus
a specific tag ="Work"
plus
a specific notebook ="Somenote"
equals
Some Title @Somenote #Work (the email title)

The body of course would be the entry. I'm wondering if anyone has a pre-baked email solution they've set-up. Ideally I will also want it to email a team email address notifying to update their Evernote, and that changes have been made.

I admit I haven't done a lot of research, and it's probably going to be a simple thing, but I like to start a discussion before jumping into research in case I reach a stumbling block.
