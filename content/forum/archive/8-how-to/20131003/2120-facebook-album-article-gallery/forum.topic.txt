Text: I found this (link:http://zach.lysobey.com/projects/fbalbum text:nice script) on the internet and I adapted a little to kirby.
Mostly, the script takes an album from a public facebook page and publish it in fancybox style on a kirby page.

Is very simple to install on a kirby site, with just a few modifications:

1. create a snippet with this content:
   
	<script type='text/javascript'>
		$(document).ready(function() {
			$('#MY_DIV_ID').fbAlbum({
				'albumID':<?php echo html($page->albumid()) ?>,
				'callback':	function(){	//code that loads after the album must go here
					$(".album a").fancybox(); 
				}
			});
		});
	</script>
	<div id="MY_DIV_ID"></div>	

2. in jquery.fbAlbum.js, replace the album ID number with

     < ? php echo html ( $ page->albumid()) ? >

3. upload the necessary files on the server
4. create a kirbytag in your .txt file

    albumid:the ID of thefacebook album

5. to use it in template, just call the snippet


here is my example:

EDIT: I don't know why the code isn't show, I used four spaces on every codeline
