Text: Hey everyone!

I need some help. I don't know php *that* well, but am confident enough to understand the basics. 

Part of my site is a photo journal, that has many entires within it's folder. I want to create an archive list that pulls in specific info from the post itself. Make sense?

Similar to the way Medium handle it: [https://medium.com/](https://medium.com/)

Something like this:

    <h4>Year</h4>
        <ul>
        <?php foreach() ?>
            <li>
                <a>
                    Post title
                    Intro text
                    Date posted
                </a>
            </li>
        <?php endforeach ?> 
        </ul>

Get the idea?

If anyone would be so kind to point me in the direction of how to build this snippet, or provide some code that I could work from that would be GREAT!

Thanks in advance.
