Text: I think I got the whole topic of this thread wrong (oops), it is working "correctly" but it's actually not what I want. Below is an example what I want the output to become:

      <p>This is a pargraph</p>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="" />

Is that possible?


Edit: Right now I've disabled the automatic line breaks as suggested in this thread: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:261

Maybe this is something that should be optional in future versions?
