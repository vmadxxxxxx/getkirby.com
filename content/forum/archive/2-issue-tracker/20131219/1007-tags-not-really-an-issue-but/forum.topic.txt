Text: Hi Bastian,
if I am correct the tagcloud plugin should assign the "active" class to any clicked tag.
This behavior doesn't apply for tags with multiple words, for example _Stress Management_ (considered as a single tag).
I believe that this is because spaces are converted in %20 so that the test at *line 49* of the tagcloud plugin doesn't succeed

<code>'isActive' => (param($options['param']) == $t) ? true : false,</code>

In my example the tag _Stress Management_ would be compared with _Stress%20Management_ and consequently fail.

I modified the tagcloud plugin in order to urldecode the param value:

<code>'isActive' => (urldecode(param($options['param'])) == $t) ? true : false,</code>

Now, even multiple words tags get the active class when clicked.

Is it safe to make this change in your code?

Thank you very much for Kirby.
