Text: @me_arno I get the same issue.

    example.com/blog/article-name

is set to switch to 

    example.com/article-name

But `/blog/article-name` flashes up briefly when switching URLs and I get a lot of duplicates showing in Webmaster Tools.

I’ve added

    Disallow '/blog/'

to my robots.txt, but I’m not sure if this is helping.
