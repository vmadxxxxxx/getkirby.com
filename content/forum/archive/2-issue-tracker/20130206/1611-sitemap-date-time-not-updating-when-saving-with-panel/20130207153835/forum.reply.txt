Text: I have the same issue too.

I simply prints last change on each page `<?php echo $page->modified('c') ?>`, after some changes via Panel the date and time remains the same.

If it's could help I'm using multi-language and:

Plugins:
- contactform
- related
- search
- thumb

Configs:
Debug on true
Cache on false

Ver.
Kirby 1.1.2
Panel 0.9.2
