Text: Great, thank you for the clarification Bastian! Just a few nuances with dates and PHP which I didn't know about.

For the record and for anyone else who might need further help:

Blueprint: mm/dd/yy
Panel Shows: 11/02/2012
Template: $page->date('F j, Y')
Rendered Date: November 2, 2012

Thanks again!
