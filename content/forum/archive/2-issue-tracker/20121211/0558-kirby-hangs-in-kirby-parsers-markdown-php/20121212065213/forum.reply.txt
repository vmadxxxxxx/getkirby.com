`max_execution_time` is thirty seconds; I am not inclined to raise it.  If something like this takes longer than 30 seconds, it's taking too long and *should* be killed.  (As a side note, I've used markdown on this same machine/setup without problems.)

I just tried this (_same_ copy) under php5.2, and it works fine.  Is anyone aware of any known issues with php5.4?
