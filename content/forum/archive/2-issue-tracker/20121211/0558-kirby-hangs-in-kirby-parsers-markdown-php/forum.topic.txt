Text: Hi,

First time using kirby.  It hangs halfway through the home page.

    Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded in [...]/kirby/parsers/markdown.php on line 372

That's in the middle of `preg_replace_callback` inside the function `hashHTMLBlocks`.  This is a clean copy of v.1.1.1; I'm running it on apache2.0 with php5.4.4.

Any ideas?  I'd like to try it out.
