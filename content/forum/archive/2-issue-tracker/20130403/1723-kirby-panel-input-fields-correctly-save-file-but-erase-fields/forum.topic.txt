Text: I'm saving out the following .txt file from the panel:

```
Title: New Business

----

Contactname: xx

----

Contactemail: asdf@asdf.com

----

Contactphone: asdf
```

Using this blueprint:

```
<?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>

# contact person blueprint

title: Contact Person
pages: false
files: false
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type:  text
  contactName:
    label: Contact Name
    type:  text
  contactEmail:
    label: Contact Email
    type: text
    validate: email
  contactPhone:
    label: Contact Phone
    type: text
```

It saves out the file correctly, however after clicking save all the input fields are erased.  

ALSO, part 2:

When clicking the plus sign to add a page I'd like to have blueprints show up in the dropdown option list, but this one isn't...all folders & files have the right permissions too...
