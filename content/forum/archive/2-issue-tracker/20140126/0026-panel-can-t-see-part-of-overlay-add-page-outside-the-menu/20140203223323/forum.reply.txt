Text: I have similar issues here, but slightly different. I'm using the latest update and chrome browser, but I can't add or delete pages when I'm on WIFI. I can only do that when I'm having regular internet connections. Anyone ever notice that?

Updates: I removed "overflow:auto". Now it works!!

Thank you for the valuable tip!
