Text: Hello,

I have been trying out Kirby and the Panel and so far it all looks impressive. Loving the speed and the minimalism. However, I am having problems in the Panel, I am constantly getting this error:


Please fix first!
Permissions
The permissions in your content directory are not set properly. Please change the permissions for all folders to 0755 and for all files to 0666
Thumbnails
Please add a thumbs directory to the main directory of your site and change its permissions to 0755


This means I cannot add new pages or delete pages via the Panel. The pages I have created have been done manually. All permissions have been set correctly. I have tried this online and locally and also had a mate of mine try it on his machine and he encountered the same issue. I have attached an image showing permissions below to show that my permissions are set correctly. We tried this on fresh installs of Kirby 1.1.0 + Panel 0.8.

Can anybody shed any insight into this please?
