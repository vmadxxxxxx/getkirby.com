Text: The instructions are misleading on some setups. Please do the following: 

Try to change the permissions for your thumbs folder in the following steps and check after each in your panel if you still get the warning for the thumbs folder: 

746
747
756
757
764
765
766
767

If you found the right setting, use that for your content folders and files.

Let me know if this does not work. I'm currently working on improving those steps.
