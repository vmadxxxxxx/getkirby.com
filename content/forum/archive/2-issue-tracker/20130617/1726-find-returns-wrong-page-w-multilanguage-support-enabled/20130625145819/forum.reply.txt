Text: thanks for that.
i also have the problem that urls without language are not redirecting to it's localized version correctly!?

e.g. yoursite.com/about should redirect to yoursite.com/en/blog

but instead it's goint to: yoursite.com/en

do you have the same problem and may found a solution for it?
