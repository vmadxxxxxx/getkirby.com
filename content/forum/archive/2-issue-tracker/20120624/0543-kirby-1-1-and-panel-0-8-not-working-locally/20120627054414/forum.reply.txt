Text: Hi,

Yes, I used both 1.1 and 0.8 but with an existing site. Just also tried with both new versions as a new site and that works.

So there must be something going on with the existing site and the new files. I havent been able to test it yet but I suspect it has to do with the new htacces file.

I'll do some more tests later.
