Text: Hi Kirbyists,

I can't get the gallery snippet to work.

I have all the files in place, but nothing shows up.
There are many images in the same folder "drawings". I also tried different formats.

[The page on my site](http://www.ruehlpublishinghouse.com/projects/drawings)

Has anyone tested this snippet yet?

Thanks a lot
