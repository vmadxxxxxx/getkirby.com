Text: Ah I see. Firstly, what you should do is using Markdown syntax in your 'Text' fields to keep it more readable. 
'## Some funny fish` will eventually end up in an h2 in the html source, so there's no need to use html there. 

In addition to that: You cannot use php code in your txt files. It won't be parsed. What you can do is name your txt file `gallery.txt` and create a template called `gallery.php` that looks exactly as your default template, but you add the `<?php snippet('gallery') ?>` after your `<?php echo $page->text() ?>`. 

Naming the txt file `gallery` will make Kirby load the specially defined `gallery.php` template.
