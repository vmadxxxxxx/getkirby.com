Text: Hi,

I'm making a website for a restaurant and I tried to have one of page to have the URL domain.tld/menu/ from the panel.

The modification was made but a but appeared in the interface of the panel. The fields part was hidden and I could only see the black sidebar with my various pages.

Is there somebody having the same issue? Can you produce the same issue?

Thanks!
