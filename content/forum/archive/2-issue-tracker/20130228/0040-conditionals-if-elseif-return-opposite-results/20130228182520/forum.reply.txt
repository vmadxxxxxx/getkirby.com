Text: Glad it is working for you @baderkamal. I'm not sure what your experience is with PHP? so apologies of this is a bit basic:

If logic code does not work, it is often because you are not matching like with like or that the code is wrong and the condition is always true/false. There is lots of good PHP help on Google ;-)
