Text: Oops. Silly mistake on my part. 

The feed.php provided in the tutorial should belong in the "kirbysitesnippetsfeed.php" and NOT "kirbysitesnippetsfeedfeed.php". I mirrored the directory structure on Github.

But I still have a problem; I get a XML Parsing error...

[IN GOOGLE CHROME]
This page contains the following errors:
error on line 1 at column 1: Document is empty
Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.

[IN OPERA]

XML parsing failed
XML parsing failed: syntax error (Line: 1, Character: 0)

Error: unexpected text (non-whitespace text outside root element) 
Specification:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/ 
  1: ﻿﻿<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!-- generator="Kirby" -->

Any thoughts?
