Text: Works for me, many thanks! I've only been using KirbyCMS for four days and I'm already loving it. 

I was having some real problems updating a client site based upon a MySQL powered CMS as part of a responsive re-design/upgrade. I decided to give Kirby a try and am very pleased I did. I've still got a few more weeks of work to go, but it is shaping up nicely.
