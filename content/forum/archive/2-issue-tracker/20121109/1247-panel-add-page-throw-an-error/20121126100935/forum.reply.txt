Text: Having this problem too on WAMP setup. I have the URL variable in the config and the subfolder variable setup for the site being in a subfolder titles "kirby" in my localhost, with my .htaccess file reflecting this setup. However, everytime i go to create a new page it just continues to add the content and page title to the error page.

Any advice?

Thanks
