Text: I do not know if it is a dirty hack, but I copied the following line in defaults.php

    c::set('404', 'error');

to my config.php and changed it to

    c::set('404', '/error');

and this works. The ugly side-effect is that the breadcrumb and navigation is not changed accordingly, but I am sure there is a solution for that too.
