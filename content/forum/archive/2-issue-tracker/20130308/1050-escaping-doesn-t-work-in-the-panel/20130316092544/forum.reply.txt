Text: I too have this problem. Or perhaps something similar...

When using an extended kirbytext tag I cannot have any parenthesis '(' or ')' inside my tags as they are used to open and close the tag itself. Escaping them _should_ work... but doesn't appear to as the OP has also found with his ordered list example.

### Here's my example

I want to create a 'footnote' custom tag, that is styled in a particular way and has id hooks for js etc... But it has to be in-line for the editor so they can place it anywhere in a paragraph. 

So I create a custom kirbytag:

	(footnote: text for my footnote id: 1)
	
	(footnote: this one does not work (<- if I add these ->) id: 2)
	
	(footnote: this one *should* work [backslash](like so[backslash]) id: 3)

Unfortunately the escape backslashes don't work at all and the following error is thrown:

Notice: Undefined index: id in [site-path]/site/plugins/kirbytext.extended.php on line 19

(line 19 is my custom function)...

Anyone know the solution?
