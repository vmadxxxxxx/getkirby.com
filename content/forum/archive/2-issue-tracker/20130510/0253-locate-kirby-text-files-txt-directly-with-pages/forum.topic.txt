Text: Following code won't work:

I defined two variables,

    <?php $main_r_t = $pages->find('response_times/main.txt') ?>
    <?php $r_t = $pages->find('response_times/times.txt') ?>

and want to load different content from both files.

It will be put in the main.php as following:

    <p><?php echo $r_t->times() ?></p>
    <p><?php echo $main_r_t->clock() ?></p>

But what happens: the __clock__ field from $main_r_t gets loaded, but the content for __times__ from $r_t (that means from file times.txt) doesn't get loaded.

Only one file in this folder is being processed. How can I address two files at once?
