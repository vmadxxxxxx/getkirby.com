Text: I can add ._ to the content ignore list which is great but we also have problems when editing the plugins we are trying develop. Anytime a mac user edits the files the page shows:

Mac OS X 	2��ATTR$o��#�#com.macromates.caret{ column = 33; line = 38; }This resource fork intentionally left blank ��

Could you ignore the ._ files when reading the plugins too?
