Text: I've found a quick fix for me: on http://serverfault.com/questions/15044/preventing-mac-os-x-clients-from-polluting-windows-shares-with-resource-forks I read about Samba being able to prevent these files from creation, so I looked up the syntax on http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#VETOFILES and added the following line to my smb.conf:

veto files = /._*/

That fixes it for me, but the issue should be solved in general.
