Text: It appears to be anything that isn't an HTML page, basically. I get something along these lines at the top:

    Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /Users/fitzage/Dropbox/Sites/joyent.com/site/plugins/truncate.php:35) in /Users/fitzage/Dropbox/Sites/joyent.com/kirby/lib/site.php on line 199

Edit: And then I googled it. I have a whitespace problem somewhere, apparently.
