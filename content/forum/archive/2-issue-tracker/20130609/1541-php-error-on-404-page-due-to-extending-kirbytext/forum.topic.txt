Text: I'm getting an odd error on the error page, which seems to be related to extending kirbytext to a plugin file. The debug output is:

	Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /home/web05410/public_html/recollection/site/plugins/kirbytext.extended.php:3) in /home/web05410/public_html/recollection/kirby/lib/site.php on line 199

Only happens on a live server, local WAMP setup is fine.

Anyone know what could be causing this?
