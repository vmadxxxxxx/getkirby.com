Text: @russbaldwin no only the config.php and .htaccess settings as provided

@roman_oroco actually the structure is

    root
    -www
    --mysite.com
    ---test
    ----site <-Kirby CMS

I had my config.php set up that way, but for some reason it's not working the way I want it to. Maybe it has something to do with my site being in a subfolder of a subfolder?
