Text: Hi Irma, I would only set it in **.htaccess**, *not in both*, so change the **config.php** back...

Assuming the rest of your .htaccess is OK ([the default one is on GitHub](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/blob/master/.htaccess))

I would set this in **.htaccess**
``` php 
RewriteBase /test/site
```

Assuming the rest of your the rest of your config.php is OK ([the default one is on GitHub](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/tree/master/site/config))

I would change this in **site/config.php**:
```php
c::set('url', 'http://www.mysite.com/test/site');
```
to
```php
c::set('url', false);
```

I would change this...
```php
c::set('subfolder', 'test/site');
```
to
```php
c::set('subfolder', 'false');
```

Let us know how it goes and mark as solved it fit all works.
