Text: Hi forum,

I don't know if this is a bug or not, but I noticed that when I don't end my panel URL with a trailing slash, I get a 310 error, too many redirects and the url in the browser changes.

Let's say the url is:

www.mysite.com/test/site/panel

It changes to

www.mysite.com/mysite.com/test/site/panel/

Could this be related to an incorrect setting in htaccess or the config file, or is it a bug?

Any help = greatly appreciated
