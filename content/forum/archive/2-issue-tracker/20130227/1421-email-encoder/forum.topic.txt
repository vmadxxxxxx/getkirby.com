Text: Hi,

I just found out that the "mailto:" part of an email link is encoded only when using the `<email_address>` syntax. It's not encoded as soon as the `(emaiI: email_address)` syntax is used (I put a capital "i" on purpose, so it's not parsed). I guess that "mailto:" part is a pretty good indicator for bots looking for email addresses. Wouldn't it be better to always encode it?
