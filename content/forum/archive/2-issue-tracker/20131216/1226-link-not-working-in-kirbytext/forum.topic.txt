Text: Hi, I'm a newbie at using Kirby and I've just finished my folio site. Everything is working pretty smoothly except some of the links set-up in kirbytext aren't working.

Please view page for example, click Details link to bring up the overlay which contains the kirbytext. The View website link isn't working.

I think it's got something to do with HTML, as the kirbytext is nested. Can anyone help on this topic?

Thanks in advance!
