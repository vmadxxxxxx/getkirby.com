Text: If you specify a linked image with KirbyText with a class, the class is applied to the link and the image. This has proved problematic with things like FancyBox and whilst you can get around it, there surely should be a better way of handling this, perhaps separate classes for link and image?

[--Original topic: Fancybox in an Article](http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:473)

In the best of both worlds KirbyText should allow for two classes, one for the image and one for the link. It currently only takes the last one you set if I do something like this:

```
( image: img.jpg  class: myImgClass  alt:AltText link: http://me.com  class: myLinkClass )
```

```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myLinkClass" 
title="img"  alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```

When what you would like would be something like:
```html
<p>
<a href="http://me.com" class="myLinkClass">
<img src="http://img.jpg" class="myImgClass" 
title="img" alt="AltText" />
</a>
</p>

```
