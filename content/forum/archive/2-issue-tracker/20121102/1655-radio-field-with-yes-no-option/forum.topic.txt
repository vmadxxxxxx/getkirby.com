Text: Can a radio field in a blueprint not have ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for its labels?

Here’s what I’m trying, but the Panel seems to have issues:

    featured:
      label: Featured?
      type: radio
      options:
        yes: Yes
        no: No
      default: no

Here’s an image of what the Panel renders though: <http://cl.ly/KcHg>

But if I swap out the labels for something else like this:

    featured:
      label: Featured?
      type: radio
      options:
        yes: Testing 1
        no: Testing 2
      default: no

The panel renders it fine: <http://cl.ly/KdZ5>
