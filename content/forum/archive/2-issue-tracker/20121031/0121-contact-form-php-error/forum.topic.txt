Text: I've been using the contact form plugin with no problems until today when I tried to move the site to a new server (Bluehost) and now the site won't load and the error log is saying its:

PHP Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in .../site/plugins/contactform/contactform.php on line 23

Tried replacing the plugin and snippets with a new download, but still getting the issue and I'm not sure what its even referring to.  I have the same thing running on another server with no problems.

Any idea where to start?

Thank you.
