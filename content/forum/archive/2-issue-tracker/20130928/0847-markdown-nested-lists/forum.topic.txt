Text: Hi,

First post so let me testify on Kirby awesomeness.
Two days playing around and I loving it !

I tryed to nest list the Markdwon way but it seems to not work accordingly.

- element level1
- element level1
	- element level2 (tab indented...)
	- element level2 (... Should appear indented with different bullet)
<pre>
- element level1

	- element level2 (tab indented...)

</pre>

Maybe I'm missing something (~.~)
