Text: I get no results @bastianallgeier. You can see it in action here: http://chrisbowler.com/search. As I haven't made any changes (that I'm aware of) other than updating the Kirby folder, I'm at a loss for what the cause might be.

As for permissions, what should the files in the templates/snippets/plugins folder be set to? I see a lot of 644 or 755 in my templates folder.
