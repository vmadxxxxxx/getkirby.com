Text: So im having a little bit of trouble getting blockquotes to parse right. This is what I have on the .txt page

    >Never half ass two things. Whole ass one thing. 
    - Ron Swanson
  
    >Everything Happens So Much
    - (link: https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928 text: Horse Ebooks)


but the html output comes out to:

    <blockquote>
    <p>Never half ass two things. Whole ass one thing. <br />
        - Ron Swanson</p>
  
      <p>Everything Happens So Much<br />
        - <a href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928">Hor     se Ebooks</a></p>
    </blockquote>

I want to have each quote wrapped in a blockquote tag, and I don't want the p tags at all.

Something Like this:

    <blockquote>
    Never half ass two things. Whole ass one thing. <br />
        - Ron Swanson
    </blockquote

    <blockquote>
    Everything Happens So Much <br />
        - <href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928">Hor     se Ebooks</a>
    </blockquote>

Can anyone tell me what I'm missing?
