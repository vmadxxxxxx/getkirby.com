I've found something that broke while creating my site - using your "build a blog" tutorial and the image embed code, this:

```php
<?php echo $article->images()->find('decoration.png')->url() ?>
```

...stops the page from outputting anything further, when it can't find that decoration.png in a directory. Am I using it correctly, is this expected behavour, or a bug?

Thanks,
