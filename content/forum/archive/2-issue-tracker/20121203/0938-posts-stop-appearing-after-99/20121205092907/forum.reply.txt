Text: Additionally to what @vis7mac wrote: If your project is a really huge blog you don't have to worry about the 2-digit sorting. You can fetch your articles with the <code>sortBy</code> method (at least until that problem is fixed). 
Just like this:

```php
$articles = $pages->find('blog')
                  ->children()
                  ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
                  ->paginate(10);
```
