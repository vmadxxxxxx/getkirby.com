Text: Hi guys,

I forgot to disable debug checking on one of my sites. Recently that server got upgraded to the latest versions of PHP, mySQL, etc. Now I get the following debug error:

    Strict Standards: Non-static method kirbytext::init() should not be called statically in <path to site>/kirby/parsers/kirbytext.php on line 7

Is that a bug? Something that I can fix on my end easily (I mean apart from simply ignoring it and disabling the debug check)?
