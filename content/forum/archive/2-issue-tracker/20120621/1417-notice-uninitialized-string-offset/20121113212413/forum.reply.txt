Text: Unfortunately I have the same :(
It occured after using the upload panel and renaming the file.
Now, this warning won't go away.  Also I can't login to the panel again... on a blank page it says "headers already sent"

Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /kirby/lib/variables.php:27) in /kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 47

Anything I can do/try? Thanks in advance.
