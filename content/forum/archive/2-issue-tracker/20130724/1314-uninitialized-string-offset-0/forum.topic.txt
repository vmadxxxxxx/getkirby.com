Im getting this error - when uploading a file (type doesnt seem to matter) and then renaming it. It is all over the page - so quite annoying. 

Setting `c::set('debug', false);` via the config files gets rid of the error - but hiding the error message doesn`t seem to be the best solution ;)

Anyone encountered this error before and can help?
