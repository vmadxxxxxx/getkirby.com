Text: I am new to Kirby.
Congratulations for this great CMS!
I'm testing   Kirby (1.1.2-17) on xampp, and  I have some issues.
I have searched on forum, but nothing is written about these...

1) When I click on a category tag, the category page gives me a Forbidden 
   warning.

2) With multi-language function  activated all it works fine, but when I 
   click on a category tag, the category page  gives me a 404 warning.

3) When I try to use the "URL-Key" instruction with Cyrillic language I 
   receive a warning page 404 ( ULR is rewritten correctly, but the   content  is not found)

4) This one  is  no a really issue but a strange output, if I try to 
insert a new field in Blueprints, before text field, this is possible in 
"Page" but not in  "Blog", in "Blog"  is possible to insert a new field 
after text field, otherwise the existing fields after the new field 
disappear in Panel interface.

I can add some screen shots, but I don't know how to do this on this forum.
Thank in advance for every help.
