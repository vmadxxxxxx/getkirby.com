Text: On this page http://getkirby.com/blog/kirbytext you explain how to create custom tags.

My questions is: How did you escape the wikipedia custom tag from being executed inside a code block?

```html
(wikipedia: Twitter)
```

For me this becomes 

```html
<a class="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Twitter">Twitter</a>
```

as code example.

Has the code hightlight plugin been updated? I can't seem to find where it is hosted...
