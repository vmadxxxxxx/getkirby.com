I don't have access to try this at present, but I think you have to pass back the full html stuff as per the example

    return '<p>'.$site->$variable().'</p>';

Assuming the variable, let us say 'email', is in your sites.txt files e.g. 

	----
	Email: user@domain.com
	----

This should return 

    <p>user@domain.com</p>

You would have to check it exists in your 'site.txt' when you do the code properly. 

Is this what you were after, I may have missed something, apologies about not being able to test the code, out on the road.
