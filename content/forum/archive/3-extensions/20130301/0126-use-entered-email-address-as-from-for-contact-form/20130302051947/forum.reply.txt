Text: In case anyone is interested in doing this, I did the following and got it to work (assuming you've set up a value 'email' in the form for this):

/snippets/contactform.php
remove line #5: 'from' => ...

/plugins/contactform/contactform.php
after line #32: $from = $self->option('from');
add new line: $email = $self->value('value');
then change line below it: if(!from) self->option('from', $to);
to: if(!from) self->option('from', $email);

Since the from option in the snippet is gone, it now tells it to set the from address as the form entered address.
