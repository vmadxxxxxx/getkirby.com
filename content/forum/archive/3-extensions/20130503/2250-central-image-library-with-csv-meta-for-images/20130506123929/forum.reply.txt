Text: If you have your data in a CSV format then this is cool ;-)

Looking at your CSV it seems like you have a painting a row, which would probably equate to one per page? So it could be set up with a painting per page in Kirby, with simple panel metatdata selection? Or indeed just metadata for the images...

```php
StockCodeode: h-15
----
Date: 1963
----
WorkTitle: Split Rocks 
----
Height: 32
----
Width: 21
----
Materials: Oil on Board
----
Ownership: Sold
```

With dropdowns/options/date selectors in the Panel for selection?

There are of course other consideration not least size and how you receive your data...
