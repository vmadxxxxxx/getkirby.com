Text: Suddenly i'm getting this PHP warning message in the search result.

    Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in /Users/username/Sites/mysite/site/plugins/search.php on line 101

    Warning: array_keys() expects parameter 1 to be array, null given in /Users/username/Sites/mysite/site/plugins/search.php on line 101

    Warning: array_intersect() [function.array-intersect]: Argument #1 is not an array in /Users/username/Sites/mysite/site/plugins/search.php on line 101

    Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /Users/username/Sites/mysite/site/plugins/search.php on line 110

I've tried reverting my code up to the moment i remember the search was working. But i'm still getting the same warning.

Any ideas?
