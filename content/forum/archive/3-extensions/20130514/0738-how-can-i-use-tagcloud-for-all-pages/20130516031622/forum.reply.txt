Text: This seems to create a tagcloud with only the first page in my page tree found and all others are ignored. Example:
- page 1 (no tags)
-- page 1.1 (tags:test, hello, world)
-- page 1.2 (tags:why, who, what)
- page 2 (tags: bastian, all, cms)

The result my cloud is showing is test, hello, world.
I have tried removing the limit setting in the array and also tried seeting it to something like 300.

The other issue that I have is that the URLs the tagcloud is producing doesn't seem to lead anywhere, when I click it, I can't see any filtered results.
