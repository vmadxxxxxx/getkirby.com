Text: Hi There,

We've notice that despite there already being a thumb for a particular image, a new thumb is generated when a different visitor browses the site.

Does the thumb plugin not use previously generated thumbnails? 

This is causing major performance issues on our test site as users visiting for the first time have to wait while new thumbs are generated - does this sound correct?

Any help would be much appreciated.

Cheers
