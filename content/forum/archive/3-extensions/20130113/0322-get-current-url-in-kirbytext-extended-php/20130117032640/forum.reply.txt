Text: Duh! I didn't know you could do that! 
What a waste of time :-(

Didn't find this in the docs, now I just found it in this tutorial:

http://getkirby.com/blog/text-formatting-101

Oh well, I can convert my function to have a paragraph with a class so it is not a complete waste of time.

Unless you're going to tell me thats possible already as well??

:-)

Thanks though!
