Text: Well, I'm just nitpicking here :-) 

I'd like to have a custom tag so instead of having to write this in a text file:

```html
<img class="someclassname" src="path/image.jpg" alt="somealttext" />
```

I could use:

```
(imageclass: someclassname imagename: image.jpg alttext: somealttext)
```
Of course a workaround would be to have the path also as an attribute but it would be a bit ugly and it would be nicer if it was automatically added from the folder this text file is in as that is the same folder where the image is.

Also, images still get wrapped in a p element but I guess that is a markdown thing...
