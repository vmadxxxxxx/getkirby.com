Text: Yes but you're just putting HTML paragraphs there. 
That is cheating :-)

On this (link: http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#header-id text: page) it says:

> With PHP Markdown Extra, you can set the id and class attribute on certain elements using an attribute block. For instance, put the desired id prefixed by a hash inside curly brackets after the header at the end of the line, like this:

```
Header 1            {#header1}
========

## Header 2 ##      {#header2}
```

But I could only get this to work with headers and ids not classes and not other elements like a P.

So I'll still use my function to get a P with a class instead of having HTML in the markdown file :-P
