Text: A pretty good real-world example would be the following. Instead of `header` and `footer` snippet you would define your content as a `section` and inject it into a master layout: A template `templates/default.php`:

    <?php section::start("content") ?>
        <h2><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h2>
        <?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>
    <?php section::end() ?>

    <?php snippet('layout') ?>

and `snippet/layout.php`:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title><?php echo html($site->title()) ?> - <?php echo html($page->title()) ?></title>
    </head>
        <body>
            <?php section::get('content') ?>
        </body>
    </html>

This makes the markup much more readable and reusable and most importantly makes the code more functional (as opposed to procedural): Instead of executing every single step on the way to your result you declare what you want your result to look like and do not do the execution yourself.
