Text: But is there a way to combine that with the Auth-Plugin?

I thought about that already but then everybody would need to type the login twice. Once on the kirby-site and then when they want to download sth. 
Or i leave the Auth Plugin out .. but then everybody could see the file list. 


Somehow Kirby has to be able to deliver the files when an authorized user asks for them but forbid access if sbdy tries to access them directly.
