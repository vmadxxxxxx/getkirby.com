Text: Hey,

I installed the auth Plugin and created a Login/Logout Page which worked all pretty good.
Now the thing is, i built the login area just for one purpose. User's should be able to login, edit their userdata (if that's even possible) and this custom data should be inserted into a certain contactform. 

Now the problem is, how do i display this data? On this Page (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/accounts text: Accounts), there is an example of custom user data. But is there anything i can do with this custom data?

Thanks,
Kim
