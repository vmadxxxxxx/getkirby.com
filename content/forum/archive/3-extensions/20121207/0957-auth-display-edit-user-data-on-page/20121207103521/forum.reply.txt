Text: Ok, i found a way to display userdata.

I made a new snippet called userdata.php.
Inside this Snippet is this:

	<?php $userdata = Auth::user() ?>
	Custom Userdata:<br />
	<?php echo html($userdata->username()) ?>
	<?php echo html($userdata->name()) ?>
	<?php echo html($userdata->firma()) ?>

So basically, the first line is getting the custom data and the last three are displaying it on the side.

So now, wherever i put <?php snippet('userdata') ?>, the userdata will be displayed.

I bet there is some easier way to do this but it works for now. Pretty sure i won't find a way to edit those custom data lines, though..
