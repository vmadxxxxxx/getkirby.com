Text: Hi,

I am using the standard contactform plugin and I want the form to additionally send a confirmation mail to the sender, can someone help me out? It's probably pretty simple, but I'm not that proficient in PHP ;)

    $form = new contactform(array(
      'to'       => 'John <john@yourdomain.com>',
      'from'     => 'Contact Form <contact@yourdomain.com>',
      'subject'  => 'New contact form request',
      'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:thank-you'
    ));

->  'to'       => 'John <john@yourdomain.com>', + sender's email

Thanks a lot!
