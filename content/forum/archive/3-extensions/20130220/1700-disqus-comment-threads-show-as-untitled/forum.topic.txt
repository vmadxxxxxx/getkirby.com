Text: Somehow the disqus snippet is broken for me.

I've looked at the snippet and also tried to set the `disqus_title` to `$page->title()` to make it work. All my comment threads show as 'Untitled' on disqus. (link: http://d.pr/i/dat8 text: Just take a look at this screenshot)

    <? snippet('disqus', array('disqus_shortname' => 'my_shortname','disqus_title' => '$page->title()')) ?>

This is not the way it should be and I can't find the solution.

Thanks to anyone who looks into this!
