Thanks Vlad. 

I just implemented a Subscribe Form with your little Plugin. It saved me some time and headache. Thank you very much


The only thing that I'd like to see changed at the moment is the placement of the php files in the content folder - that's not very pretty. 
This way my clients will see a page in the panel that they may not mess with. Couldn't that have been stored somewhere else? Also: I will have to create a blueprint for the panel to get rid of the error-message in the main panel page. (Or maybe there's another way to get rid of those?)

Nevertheless: Nice and working Plugin. Thanks again
