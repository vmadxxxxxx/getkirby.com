Text: Hello,

I have been working on internal "Comments" plugin for Kirby, and I'd appreciate any feedback from Kirby community. Get the files and read "readme" here:
<https://github.com/vladstudio/vladstudio-kirby-comments>

Some things I am interested in:

* do you actually need comments on **your** Kirby site?
* was the plugin easy to understand and install?
* what is the most important feature that I missed?
* what (if anything) would prevent you from using it in production?

(Note - it's beta yet, no guarantees!)

Thanks!
