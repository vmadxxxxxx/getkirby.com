Text: I'm digging Kirby more and more :-)

I just spent a day pulling my hair out, trying to make email plugin work - it's been working on local machine but not in production :-( In the end, I decided to give up and make a Kirby plugin from a PHP class I used before. Hence:

<https://github.com/vladstudio/vladstudio-kirby-amazon-ses>

... which, mysteriously, worked. 

Uses the same config as email plugin:

    c::set('email.use', 'amazon');
    c::set('email.amazon.key', 'Your Amazon SES Key');
    c::set('email.amazon.secret', 'Your Amazon SES Secret');

Based entirely on SES PHP class * Copyright (c) 2011, Dan Myers.
Which is in turn based on Donovan Schonknecht's Amazon S3 PHP class.
