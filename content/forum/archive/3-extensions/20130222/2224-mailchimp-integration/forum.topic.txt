Text: Has anyone made (or is making) an integration for Kirby with MailChimp?

Would anyone be interested in one? If so, what would you be looking for this integration to do?

I’m very interested in the idea of having a ‘Send to MailChimp’ button within the Kirby Panel which would send a page’s content over to MailChimp and auto-create a campaign for you.
