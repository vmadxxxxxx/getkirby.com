Text: I'm not quite clear what you mean here? The Kirby tags are for inserting (usually single items) into some text... What you seem to be after is a array of child pages with their images? Presumably a specific image in each child folder? 

The code below list the first image in each visible child page, sorry if I have mis-understood (I think I may have).

```php
<h3>Image loop of Children - getting first image in child folder<h3>
   <?php foreach($page->children()->visible() as $image): ?>
     <figure>
        <img src="<?php echo $image->images()->first()->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($image->title()) ?>" />
        <figcaption><?php echo html($image->title()) ?></figcaption>
     </figure>
     <br/>
   <?php endforeach ?>
```
