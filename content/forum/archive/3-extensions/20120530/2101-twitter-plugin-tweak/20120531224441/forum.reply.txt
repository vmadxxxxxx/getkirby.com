Text: How did you end up resolving this? I just rolled back to embedding my twitter feed with Twitters javascript: 

```
<script type="text/javascript"
src="http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js"></script>
       <script type="text/javascript"
src="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/TWITTERNAME.json?callback=twitterCallback2&amp;count=5"></script>
```

There are things I prefer with both methods but if the links are working in the PHP method I may go back to it.
