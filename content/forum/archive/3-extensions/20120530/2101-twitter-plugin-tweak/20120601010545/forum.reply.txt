Text: I wish this forum would send notifications or something. I don't know when there's something new. Anyway…

I added this code (already forgot where I got it) to the top of the tweets.php plugin file (inside the opening php tag).

Then, down below where you have the line

'text' => $tweet['text'],

I changed it to

'text' => auto_link_text($tweet['text']),
