Text: I'd like the option in the Tweets plugin to auto-link URLs in the tweets. Right now it's just displaying them on the page, which is kind of useless to me. I'd auto-link them myself, but I tried doing that in PHP using some instructions I found with no success, so I probably don't know what I'm doing.
