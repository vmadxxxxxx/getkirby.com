Text: Hi guys,

I'm looking for two things:

1. a way to customize the email subject line for the contact form plugin.
2. To include a replyto, based on the email entered by user

Currently, the subject line is set in advance within the initialization of the new contactform 

```php
$form = new contactform(array(
	'to'       => 'Name <name@email.com>',
	'from'     => 'Contact Form <contactform@email.com>',
	'subject'  => 'New contact form request',
	'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:thank-you',
	'honeypot' => 'email2'
));
```

The ideal solution would be as follow

```php
$form = new contactform(array(
	'to'       => 'Name <name@email.com>',
	'from'     => 'Contact Form <contactform@email.com>',
	'replyto'  => $emailentered,
	'subject'  => $nameEntered . 'Sent a New message',
	'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:thank-you',
	'honeypot' => 'email2'
));
```

I added two extra variables (that should be captured when user submits the form): 
```php

$emailentered = $form->htmlValue('email');
$nameEntered  = $form->htmlValue('name');

```

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you
