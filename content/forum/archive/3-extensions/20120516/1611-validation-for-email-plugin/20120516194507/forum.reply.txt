Text: I think you made the right decision :)

I was planning to release a form plugin, which helps you submit and validate forms, but it's still more or less a far-future project. 

As you already mentioned, the kirby validation methods are quite useful – I hope :)

Receiving values from a request is also very straight forward: 

```php

// I use to add name="submit" to the submit button
// to check when the form has been submitted
// like this: 
if(get('submit')) {
 
  // getting some example values from a contact form
  // get() is a shortcut for $_GET['email'] and $_POST['email']
  // it also takes care of trimming and escaping slashes
  $email = get('email');
  $name  = get('name');
  $text  = get('text');

  if(!v::email($email)) {
    // do something on invalid inputs
  }

}

```

This is a very basic example, how I would handle form requests Kirby-style. 

I hope it helps!
