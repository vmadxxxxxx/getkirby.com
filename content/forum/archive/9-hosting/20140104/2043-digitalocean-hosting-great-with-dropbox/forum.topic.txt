Text: Digital Ocean hosting : 

- very cheap ! 5$ a month
- has much documentation ! so much that i could set up my VPS and dropbox and I know nothing about using a server in SSH
- is very straight forward in installation
- no hassle in the sign up !

honestly I have tried gandi / webfaction / OVH / linode (great as well but much pricier ) digital ocean is just great !
