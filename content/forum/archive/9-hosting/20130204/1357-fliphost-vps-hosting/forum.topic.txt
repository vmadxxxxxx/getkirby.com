Text: Whenever Bastian posted the instructions for Dropbox syncing, I quickly started looking for VPS hosting (primarily for SSH access, something shared hosting (in my case, [StableHost](http://getkirby.com/forum/hosting/topic:341)) doesn't typically offer. My main criteria was cost. I was looking for VPS hosting for less than $10/month.This is why I didn't opt for Linode, which starts at $20/month. 

While searching, I was referred to Fliphost. Their VPS hosting starts at $6/month. According to its owner, they're able to achieve such a low price by offering unmanaged hosting. In other words, they generally don't involve themselves in managing your server. This doesn't mean that support is non-existent. In fact, for the few times I had problems, they responded promptly and helpfully. 

Hence, I can vouch for Fliphost. They're great for anyone who is looking for cheap VPS hosting. Be warned: it's unmanaged, so you should know a bit of system administration or be able to google stuff (which is what I did).
