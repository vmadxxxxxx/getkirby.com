Text: I collected a few recommendations for great hosting providers and plans on the (link: hosting text: hosting page). But the best way to really share insights and give recommendations is to actively discuss this here IMHO. 

Let's start discussing about different providers and plans and about their performance, reliability, support, etc. 

**I suggest to start new topics for each provider or special hosting plan, so we can keep stuff a bit separated.**

I'm very much looking forward to your thoughts.
