Text: Hey guys, 

that might be just me here in Germany with a latency problem, but I currently worked with a guy, who tried to run a Kirby site on (gs) and the performance wasn't great at all. Would love to hear more from people who use Kirby on (gs). 

It seems that the (dv) seems to be a good choice though.
