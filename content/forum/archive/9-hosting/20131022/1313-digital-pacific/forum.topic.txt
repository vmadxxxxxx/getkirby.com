Text: I'm currently trying to install Kirby on [Digital Pacific](https://www.digitalpacific.com.au).

I've used Kirby in the past without too much trouble but I'm unable to get the install working on Digital Pacific > [My site](http://thomasgreen.com.au/kirby/). It throws a blank white screen.

The only issue on the forum that sounded close, i.e. "blank white screen" was a [Problem with Mac meta files](http://getkirby.com/forum/issue-tracker/topic:32/#post106) but not sure if this is at all related.

I've been able to get the install (V1.1.2) working on a different web host, but not Digital Pacific.

I'm fairly sure this is a hosting issue, I'll report once I hear back from them. Any ideas in the meantime would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Thomas
