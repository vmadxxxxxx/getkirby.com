Text: @fitzage - Thanks for the quick reply.

The web host added some code to the .htaccess to send PHP errors to the browser and log.

    php_flag display_startup_errors on
    php_flag display_errors on
    php_flag html_errors on
    php_flag log_errors On
    php_value error_log / ... (ftp path) ... /kirby/error_log

There was one error, as follows:

**Fatal error: Cannot redeclare get() in ... (ftp path) ... kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 2337**

They said as far as they can tell it's a Kirby issue.

Any help would be appreciated.
