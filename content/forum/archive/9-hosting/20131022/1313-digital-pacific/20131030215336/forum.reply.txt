Text: Tech support at Digital Pacific tried a clean install which had the same problem, so I'm guessing it's not as simple as a config or .htaccess. PHP version is also adequate. Full email from the hosting support below.

Hi Thomas,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I was going through the support forums to check whether there are any known issues with Kirby CMS.

I set up a free trial version of Kirby in a test directory and noticed that the same error is encountered while accessing the site :

=========

thomasgr@thomasgreen.com.au [~/public_html/dptest]# php index.php
PHP Fatal error: Cannot redeclare get() in /home/thomasgr/public_html/dptest/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 2337
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.27
Content-type: text/html

=========

I checked and confirmed that the issue is not due to the server configuration. The server meets all the requirements for the Kirby installation (As mentioned in their website http://getkirby.com/hosting). The PHP version on the server is 5.3.27.

The issue appears to be with the function declaration in " /home/thomasgr/public_html/dptest/kirby/lib/kirby.php". I read in Kirby support forums that the MySQL database support is not required for Kirby CMS. However, when I checked the file " /home/thomasgr/public_html/kirby/kirby/lib/kirby.php", I noticed a database connection definition section :

========

static function connect() {

$connection = self::connection();
$args = func_get_args();
$host = a::get($args, 0, c::get('db.host', 'localhost'));
$user = a::get($args, 1, c::get('db.user', 'root'));
$password = a::get($args, 2, c::get('db.password'));
$database = a::get($args, 3, c::get('db.name'));

======

The error occurs when the function "get()" is declared more than once in a file. Unfortunately, the issue is out side of our support boundaries. Please consult with a developer or contact Kirby developers (http://getkirby.com/contact) so as to fix the issue. 

You can check the PHP configuration for the domain via the URL : http://thomasgreen.com.au/kirby/phpinfo.php

Fixing the coding issues with the customer website is outside of our support boundaries as defined in https://digitalpacific.com.au/esupport/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/414/0/sharedreseller-hosting-support-boundaries
