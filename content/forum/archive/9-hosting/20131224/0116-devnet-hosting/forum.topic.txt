Text: Hi all:

I usually only do hosting via people I know personally or those whom contact me with a project or some such, but I am willing to host kirby based sites on my server, for free.
It would have to be on 'srv51' in such a case, you can bring your own domain, or use a subdomain provided by me, which will also be benefiting from the services provided by CloudFlare (professional plan). CloudFlare RailGun is also available on 'srv51'.
Status can be seen here:

If anybody should be interested then I can be reached via [i.am@k0nsl.org](mailto:i.am@k0nsl.org)

Merry Christmas, all!

Faithfully,
Kuensl
