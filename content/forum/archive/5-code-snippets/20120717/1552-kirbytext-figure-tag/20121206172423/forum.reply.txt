Text: Is there a way to make the image inside the figure tag a smaller thumb of the original (like a max-width of 300px or something), then wrap that image in an anchor tag and link to the original (larger) version?

So the final HTML would look like this:

    <figure>
      <a href="fullsize.jpg">
        <img src="smallsize.jpg" />
      </a>
      <figcaption>This is a nice figure</figcaption>
    </figure>
