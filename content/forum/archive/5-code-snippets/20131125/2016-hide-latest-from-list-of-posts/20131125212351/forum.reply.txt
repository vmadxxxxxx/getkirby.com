Text: I would do something like this:

```php
    <?php {$articles = $pages->find('journal')
            ->children()
            ->visible()
            ->without($lastarticle->uid())
            ->sortBy($sort='date', $dir='asc')
            ->flip()
            ->paginate(5);
        } ?>
```

That might work. I haven't actually tested it.
