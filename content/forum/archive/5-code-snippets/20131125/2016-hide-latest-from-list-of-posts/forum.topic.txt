Text: Hi,

I'm building a tiny blog with Kirby (which is really great!), and was hoping to get some hints from someone a little wiser than me when it comes to PHP.

On the first page of the blog I have echoed the latest article, and beneath it I have a list of links to older posts. In this list however, I'd like to leave out the latest post, since it's already displayed. How do I do this?

I'm fetching the latest article like this:
```
<?php $lastarticle = $pages->find('journal')
                      ->children()
                      ->visible()
                      ->last()
?>
```

And the rest of the posts like this:
```
<?php {$articles = $pages->find('journal')
	                    ->children()
	                    ->visible()
                        ->sortBy($sort='date', $dir='asc')
	                    ->flip()
	                    ->paginate(5);
	} ?>
```

How can I leave out the `$lastarticle` from the list above? I'm sure there's a really easy solution, but I can't seem to find it.

Thanks in advance,
Simon
