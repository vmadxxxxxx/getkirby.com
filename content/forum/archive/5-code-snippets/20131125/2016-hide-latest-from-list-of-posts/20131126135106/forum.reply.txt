Text: Wow, thanks for the help.

The `without`-solution worked out just fine.

I couldn't get the `->slice`- and the `->offset`-solutions to work.
The function works, but since I also have a `->flip` it cuts from the bottom. And setting a negative number didn't seem to do the trick either. 

Anyway, it works now. Thanks a lot!
