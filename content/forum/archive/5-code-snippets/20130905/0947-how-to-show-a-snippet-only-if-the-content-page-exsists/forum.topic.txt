Text: Hey! I am looking to make a Jumbotron from bootstrap on my page, I however only want the snippet to be called if the content for it (an invisible page) exsists

my code is

    <?php 
    foreach ($pages->findByUID('jumbotron') as $section):
    snippet($section->uid(), array('data' => $section)); 
    endforeach
    ?>

how can I change it to check if the 'jumbotron' UID exists?
