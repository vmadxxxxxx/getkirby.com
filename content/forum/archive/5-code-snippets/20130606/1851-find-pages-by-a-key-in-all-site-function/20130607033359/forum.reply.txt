Text: I don't know if `$site->pages()->index()` could works, anyone knows?

**UPDATE**

Using the undocumented index() function also works:

	$pages = (new Pages($pages->visible()->index()))->filterBy('template',  'templateName');

First you need to index all pages an then create a new instance of Pages.
