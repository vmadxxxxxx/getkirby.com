Text: Very much like [Multi-FilterBy on Page Fields with Form Selection](http://getkirby.com/forum/code-snippets/topic:460), the key difference being that in this version the filters act individually rather than together, so you can select none, one, two, or three filters in the example

I put it up on [Gist -- kirbycms-individualmultifilterby.php](https://gist.github.com/shoesforindustry/5058198#file-kirbycms-individualmultifilterby-php)

Enjoy...
