Text: If you attempt to use the Disqus plugin when you have relative URLs set:

    c::set('url', '/');

You'll get error similar to:

> We were unable to load Disqus. If you are a moderator please see our [troubleshooting guide](http://docs.disqus.com/help/83/).

The reason is because Disqus is looking for absolute URLs to pass to their system -- and the defaults that Kirby will use will be the relative paths (due to the site config).

So - a fix for this would be to add a new site variable in `/content/site.md`, something like the following:

    Full URL: http://yourdomain.com

Then, inside of your template files, you can call the Disqus snippet like so:

	// disqus
	// need to specify 'disqus_identifier' and 'disqus_url' because we're using relative URLs
	snippet('disqus', array(
		'disqus_shortname'  => 'YOUR-SHORTNAME',
		'disqus_developer'  => true,
		'disqus_identifier' => $site->full_url . thisURL(),
		'disqus_url'        => $site->full_url . '/' . $page->uri()
	))

There's obviously a bit of responsibility on your part to make sure the `full_url` var is up to date... but you already knew that ;)

Also - MAMP Pro is your friend here -- I just set up a new virtual host to point to my `Sites/` folder and I'm golden.

First Kirby project and loving it so far. Thanks all!
