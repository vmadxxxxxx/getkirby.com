Text: Hey guys,

So, I love the simplicity of Kirby but I wanted to be able to give each of my images a unique caption that I can show via the title attribute. I thought a while about how I can do this then realised that images have a description field available in their exif data and it's easily editable in iPhoto. All I had to do was figure out how to show it on the page.

The good news is that since version 4.2, PHP has had the [get_exif_data](http://php.net/manual/en/function.exif-read-data.php) function available to do just that! So here's my modification to the gallery snippet that pulls the description from the exif data and shows it as a title attribute (also, using the thumbnail plugin)

    <?php if($page->hasImages()): ?>
    	<ul class="gallery">
    	  <?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
    			<?php
    			$description = '';
    			$exif = @exif_read_data($image->url());
    			if(!$exif === false && array_key_exists('UserComment', $exif)):
    				$description = trim($exif['UserComment']);		
    			endif;
    			?>
    		  <li>
    		    <a href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" rel="group" title="<?php echo $description ?>">
    					<?php echo thumb($image, array('height' => 180)) ?>
    				</a>
    		  </li>
    	  <?php endforeach ?>
    	</ul>
    <?php endif ?>

You can see it in action on [this gallery page on my personal blog](http://andywarburton.co.uk/blog/magic-at-disney-paris) by hovering over most of the images or clicking on them to see the lightbox.

I hope this is of use to someone. Enjoy!
