Text: Hey,

I wanted to have some little FancyBox galleries inside my text, so I needed a kirbytext extension. Here's a little snippet which gives you a nice and handy kirbytag to generate some thumbnails which opens the original in a FancyBox if you like.

Guess, it could be improved a little, but this is my first, quick version.
