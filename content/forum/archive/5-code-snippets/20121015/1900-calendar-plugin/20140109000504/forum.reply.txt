Text: Not to resurrect a potentially dead thread, but I'm curious what happened to this plugin? It was looking to be quite an useful one to add to Kirby and one that I had in mind for doing a project with.

Edit-- Github threw a curveball last night with this showing up as 404 then. All is good this morning. Phew.

Looking forward to trying this on a client project with Kirby and Calendar for events for a little motorcycle club :)
