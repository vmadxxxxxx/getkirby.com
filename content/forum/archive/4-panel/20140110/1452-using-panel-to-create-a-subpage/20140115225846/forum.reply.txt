Text: Yep, your blueprint needs to allow pages if it doesn't already.

Each blueprint should begin with:

    title: Blueprint title
    pages: true
    files: true

You can enable/disable both subpages and file uploads for a blueprint by setting their respective values to true/false.

You should then be able to create a new subpage by clicking [this button.](http://d.pr/i/bnzA)
