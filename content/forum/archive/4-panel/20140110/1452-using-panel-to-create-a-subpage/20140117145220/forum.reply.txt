Text: Ah, that was it. Actually I had both set to true on the blueprint for the event subpages, but I had 'files' set to false on the blueprint for the parent 'events' page. I set them all to 'true'.

Then it let me see "event" in that little select menu to choose what kind of page I want when I create a new page.

Thanks!
