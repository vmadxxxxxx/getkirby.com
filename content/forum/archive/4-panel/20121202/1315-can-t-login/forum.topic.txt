Text: Hey everybody, 

I had the Panel up an running for a short time during developing my site. Then I updated to Kirby 1.1 and the respective panel version. 

Now I can't login anymore. The Login-Window always gives me a "red button" whatever I type in. 

in "panel/defaults/accounts" I have a file with my user and tried md5-ed and unencrypted passwords. None were taken. 

Anything I can do to get this to work again?

Cheers, Tim
