Text: I've got a site behind a global firewall using the Authentication plugin, I'm also using the panel.

When I log into the panel I get logged out of the site, which results into a endless logging in and out if you for example want to edit a page and preview.

Is this expected behaviour or am I missing something, I've done extensive testing with different account settings. 

Thanks for your reply
