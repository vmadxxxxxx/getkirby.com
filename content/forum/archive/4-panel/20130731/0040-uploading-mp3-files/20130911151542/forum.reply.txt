Text: Hello rappold. I experienced the exact scenario you were having, however, I'm happy to say there's a solution! 

1.) In the /site/panel/config/config.php file be sure to add this 'audio/mp3' to the allowed MIME types array.

2.) In your main HTACCESS file insert: AddType audio/mp3 .mp3

Basically, you just needed to tell Apache how to handle this type of file. I hope this helps and keep on, keeping on.
