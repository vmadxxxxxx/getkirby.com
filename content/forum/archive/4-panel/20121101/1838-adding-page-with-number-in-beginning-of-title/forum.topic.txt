Text: I've been using Kirby and Panel for an architecture site where a lot of projects (pages) need to have a number in the beginning (since they go by address).  When adding a title with a numeric beginning, after hitting 'Save' I get a 'The page has not been found' error.  If I refresh, the page is actually there, but automatically sorted into the visible section and if I look at the folder name in the file structure, the number beginnings are there, however if I re-sort them, it removes the intended number beginning and replaces it with a sequential one.

Is there any way to indicate that the numeric beginning is intended when adding in panel, or is this something that has to be fixed via FTP?

Thank you!
