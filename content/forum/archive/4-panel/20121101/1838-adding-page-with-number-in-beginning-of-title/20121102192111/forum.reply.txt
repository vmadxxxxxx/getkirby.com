Text: I have the same issue.

I have a client who’s project titles often start with a building number, for instance, **1000 Broadway Ave**.

When I add a new project in the panel and type ‘1000 Broadway Ave.’ into the title and click ‘Save’, I get a 404 error.

I’m going to have a hard time explaining not to put numbers first to any client, and expect everyone from their team to remember. Is there any way to fix this issue?
