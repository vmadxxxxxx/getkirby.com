Text: **Hi all,**

Today I tried to upload a new project to my website. Kirby is installed a long time ago so is the panel. Everything goes perfect except for today.

When I try to edit / delete an image from a project I get 2 errors:

****

**Edit:**
Notice: Trying to get property of non-object in ...\panel\lib\form.php on line 297

**Delete:**
Fatal error: Call to a member function filename() on a non-object in ...\panel\snippets\files.delete.php on line 23

****

I already tried to update the panel and kirby folder to the last version.

I hope someone can help me out here.
Thanks.
