Text: Normally if you activate multi-language support, the URL field automatically acts like the following: 

1. for the default language it will change the folder name
2. for translations it will automatically add a url-key field to your text files with translated versions. 

You don't have to define the URL-key field by hand. 

I hope this helps.
