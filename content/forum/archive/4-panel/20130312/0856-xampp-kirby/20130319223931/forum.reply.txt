Text: For anyone else trying Xampp... Sascha Lack got it right here:
http://sashtown.de/how-to-install-kirby-on-xampp/

It's now much easier, just go to the .htaccess file right around line #19 and change your rewrite base, this is the only change required.

Such as this one, mine is in a root folder called getkirby in my Xampp htdocs folder, giving me this: (hint the ### lines are commented out lines, so look for the line that does not have the #'s :)

RewriteBase /getkirby 

If the site were installed in the root of htdocs you would not need to make any changes as the root slash was already there on that line.

Easy... peasy...
