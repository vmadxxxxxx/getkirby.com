Text: I guess I should clarify...

The ‘show more...’ link has *always* been there in the Panel. However, I can’t turn it off, nor can I change the value. So it seems to be ‘stuck’.

For example, here's my blueprint for the Portfolio section of my site:

    <?php if(!defined('KIRBY')) exit ?>
    
    title: Portfolio
    pages:
      template: project
      limit: 5
    files: false
    fields:
      title: 
        label: Title
        type:  text

And here’s a screenshot of what the Panel looks like with those settings: http://cl.ly/Kd2U


Notice that 10 are showing in the sidebar, even though I've specified 5.
