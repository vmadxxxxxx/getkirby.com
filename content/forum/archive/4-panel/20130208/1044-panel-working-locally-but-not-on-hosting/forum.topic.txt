Text: Hi I've got a slight annoying problem. The panel works locally all fine, iI can log in edit delete etc. But on my host I can only login in. Anytime I try to edit anything It just defaults to my 404 on my site. Its worth noting that I'm on a windows host.

Could anyone help direct me to things i should check to get it to work.
