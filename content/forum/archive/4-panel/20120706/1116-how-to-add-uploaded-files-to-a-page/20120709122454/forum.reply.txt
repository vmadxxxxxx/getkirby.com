Text: There are two ways to add images to your content. You can add page-specific images right to your templates: <http://getkirby.com/docs/media> so they will be autoloaded. 

Or you can add them to your content directly via a simple tag: 

```
(\image: myimage.jpg)
```

You can read more about it here: 
<http://getkirby.com/blog/text-formatting-101>

There's the plan to offer a format button for this right in the panel, so you won't need to remember how to write that tag.
