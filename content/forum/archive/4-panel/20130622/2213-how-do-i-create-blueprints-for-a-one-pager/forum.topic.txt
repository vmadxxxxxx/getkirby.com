Text: I have used the instructions in the [blog post](http://getkirby.com/blog/one-pager) from this website to create a 'one page' website.

I am installing the panel now, and notice that I don't seem to have the possibility to create blueprints for my separate pages, because they have no corresponding template file – as they are being called in the 'main' home.php template file as snippets.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: Solved. Just made 'placeholder' templates (that are not necessarily being used) and took it from there

EDIT: Didn't even need the placeholder templates. Ignore this topic altogether
