Text: I use Git to deploy my site. Everything is synced. I have two Kirby configuration. For local and staging (as instructed in the Multi-environment tutorial). I disable rewrite on my local config though. Sorry forgot to mention that.

Apart from that, most of the setup is almost the same.

The local server is on OSX 10.8.5 running Apache 2.2.22 and PHP 5.3.15 with mod_rewrite enabled.

The staging server is on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (AWS EC2) running Apache 2.2.22 and PHP 5.3.10 with mod_rewrite enabled.

Here's my staging server domain config (website name has been replaced):

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		DocumentRoot "/var/www/mysite.com"
		ServerName mysite.com

		<Directory "/var/www/mysite.com">
			Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
			AllowOverride All
			Order allow,deny
			Allow from all
		</Directory>

		ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/mysite.error.log
		CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/mysite.access.log combined
	</VirtualHost>
