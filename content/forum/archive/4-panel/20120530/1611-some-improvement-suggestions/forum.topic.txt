Text: First of all I have to say that I absolutely love Kirby and The Panel (and this forum)! But only because I love them doesn't mean that there are no improvements that could be made, so I have a few suggestion:
1. It'd be nice if I could choose in the "new site" overlay if I want the page to be visible or invisible.
2. I'd love to see a full translation of all labels especially the ones on the main page displaying general information about the site and the ones visible when editing a page.
3. An option that allows me to change the template/blueprint of any page after the creation without manually doing it by renaming the file in the specific folder would be really handy.
4. Seeing the full message displayed here would really help :) http://cdn.hnrch02.me/H0EY
Those are just some little annoyances I wanted to mention. I hope this helps you in some way ;)
