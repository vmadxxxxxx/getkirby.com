And, basically, that’s what I’m doing now for putting these images on the frontend of the site: I’m using the thumb plugin to scale them down to my desired size for the template.

However, as I mentioned, I’m finding that the Thumb plugin chokes with larger images (around 2500/3000px and up). So when my client uploads super large images, I get notifications of errors on the site.
