Text: Is there a way to put a limit on the size/dimensions of an image being uploaded through the Panel?

If an image above 2000px wide or tall (or some other threshold) is uploaded, it’d be great to have a simple error be thrown that states the image needs to be scaled before uploading.

In most cases, such large images are completely unnecessary and it sometimes chokes the Thumb plugin.

For now I’m limiting the actual file size of an upload via my .htaccess file, but I’m really hoping for a more robust solution that detects actual image dimensions.

I assume it would function somewhat along the lines of: when an image is uploaded, PHP would analyze dimensions against a predefined maximum size (could be set within the site’s panel config file) and if it doesn’t meet the requirements, dump the upload and show an error.
