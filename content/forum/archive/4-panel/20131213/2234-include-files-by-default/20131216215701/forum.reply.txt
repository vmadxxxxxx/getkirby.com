Text: My goal is to set up easy CSS access and control for a client ~ 

each of their project-pages will have a bunch of elements (which I will ID as #one, #two, #three etc), which will vary in content: embedded video & audio, images, and different types of text blocks. And so on

Then they'll tweak and re-style that page using the CSS that is in the same folder.

This way they won't have to worry about compound selectors, a huge CSS file to deal with, and the possibility of modifying content on other pages by mistake. And, they'll be able to use a previous project's CSS file as a reference or template if they want something similar in the future.

In the mean time, I'll just have them copy the CSS file in with the rest of their content - but it would be nice to automate things for them as much as possible.
