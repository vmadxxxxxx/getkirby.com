Text: Hello there; 
I'm fiddling around with Kirby and found it crystal clear for now on ( very relaxing I find if you ask :)
Well, I hitted this thread problem pretty soon.
NONE of the remedies exhibited here solved.
MY problem lied in I renamed the [panel] folder to [whatever]
BUT the default install htaccess includes:

    RewriteRule ^panel/(.*) panel/index.php [L]

you have to change accordingly.
