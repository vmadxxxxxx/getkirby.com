Text: Kirby is working great, just like it should! So I thought I'd give The Panel a go. 

All the latest files from github (not dev) and having the panel folder in root just gives me this:

`Error: The page has not been found`

I've got it set up like this
`domain.com/test/`

and
`domain.com/test/panel`

Image to show this better:
