Text: Hi,
i am struggling with the panel and the permission management. 

I can edit infos, upload images, but i can't create new pages, apparently it is impossible to create the text files.
This is the alert: The data could not be added.

The permissions for all folders and files in the content folder are set to 777 with no effect.

I installed kirby on some servers already and never had that problem before...
