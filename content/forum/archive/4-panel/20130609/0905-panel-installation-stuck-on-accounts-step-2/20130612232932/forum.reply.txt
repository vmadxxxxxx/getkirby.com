Text: @dokdeleon, yeah I tried that before posting. It displayed a lot but nothing jumped out at me. In the meantime, since I am using VMs, I spun up another standard Lampstack image using Vagrant (vagrantup.com) and everything worked out perfectly. I strongly suspect I messed up permissions on the first go round. Thanks for taking the time to reply with hints.
