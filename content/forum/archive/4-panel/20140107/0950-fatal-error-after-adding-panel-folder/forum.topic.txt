Text: I added the panel folder (dev tree) to kirbytax version and when I go to localhost/kirbytax to get the installation instructions I get this:

```
Fatal error: Cannot make non static method uri::raw() static in class paneluri in kirbytax/panel/lib/uri.php on line 15
```

Anyone any idea?
