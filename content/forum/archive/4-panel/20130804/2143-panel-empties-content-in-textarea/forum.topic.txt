Text: I'm not shure if this is a bug or just me being stupid, but I have a small problem with the panel: It seems to delete/hide the input of a certain field (`video_ID`). Everything is saved to the .txt, so the post works fine, but as soon as I hit "save" or when I open the post again in the panel, the textfield is empty again. If tried changing it to a textarea, but that didn't help either. Could the problem be the "gibberish" input?
