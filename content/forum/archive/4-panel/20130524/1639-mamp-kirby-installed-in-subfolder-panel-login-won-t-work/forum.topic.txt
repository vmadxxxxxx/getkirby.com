Text: Hello community,

i just discovered kirby by today and i really like it.
But when trying to install the PANEL on my local MAMP, the installation routine hangs at step 2. Pushing the LOGIN button shows no response?

My folder structure looks like that:
http://is.gd/GTp8Qq

I installed Kirby the subfolder .../htdocs/kirby/ (http://localhost:8888/kirby/panel/ in the browser). I changed the rewrite base and the config according to that, so the site itself runs perfect. I renamed the admin.php to my desired username and filled in the login data.

What did I maybe wrong? Thanks for your help.
