Text: Tried. Also switched back to a single config-file. And tried a complete fresh kirby- and panel-installation. Kirby-site works. Panel ({myname.local}/{subfoldername}/panel) allways messages "500 Internal Server Error". Really seems something is broken with my MAMP  ;..(
Hopefully I'll able to figure it out.
Thx for the reply.
