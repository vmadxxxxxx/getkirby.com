Text: This works great to add "tag" buttons, however I'm not sure how to add "overlay" buttons such as this:

    'youtube' => '<a href="#form-overlay-youtube" 
    rel="overlay">' . l::get('form.buttons.youtube') 
    . '</a>'

I mean, where exactly do I have to create that overlay, there must be some code somewhere generating it but I can't find it! I know there are 2 already: link and email. 

Anyone can help me?

Thanks!
