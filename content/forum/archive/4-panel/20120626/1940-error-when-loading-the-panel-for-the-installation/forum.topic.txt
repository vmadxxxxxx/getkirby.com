I installed Kirby correctly in a subfolder, and made the right changes in the config.php file:

c::set('url', 'http://localhost:8888/klsoptim');
c::set('subfolder', 'klsoptim');

and in the .htaccess

RewriteBase /klsoptim

Then I downloaded the panel folder, pasted it in the my subfolder and renamed it.

However, when I try to access it from my browser:

http://localhost:8888/klsoptim

I get the custom error page.

Am I forgetting something ?
