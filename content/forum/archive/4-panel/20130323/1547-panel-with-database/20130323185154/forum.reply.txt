Text: Kirby is Text file or Markdown file based CMS. If you want a database based CMS then you may not want Kirby?

This is not to say you cannot use Kirby with a database, you can, but not really for page content storage with the Panel. 

See ['Kirby loves MySQL'](http://getkirby.com/blog/database) and also the [Toolkit](http://toolkit.getkirby.com/).
