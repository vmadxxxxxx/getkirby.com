Text: Hi,

I'm wondering if it'd be possible to autofill fields e.g. when creating a new blog post, to make the date today's date (all via Kirby Panel).

Would this be possible to do in the blueprint?

Also, it'd be awesome if the forum had a search facility, so that I (and other people) know if there is already a topic on the same thing, saving reposting.

Thanks,
Rob
