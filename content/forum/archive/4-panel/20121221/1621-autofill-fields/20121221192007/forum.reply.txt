Text: awesome, thanks for the reply, I didn't realise you could edit fields, I ended up changing `echo html($value);` to 
    `if(!$value){`
    `    echo html(date('Y-m-d'));`
    `} else if($value){`
    `    echo html($value);`
    `}`
and that works perfectly now :D
(I couldn't seem to get the code blocks working in this reply :( )
