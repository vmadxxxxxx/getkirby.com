Text: Hi!

How do I add a line break in the help text of a field?

I already tried [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/in-yaml-how-do-i-break-a-string-over-multiple-lines), but it didn't work:

    text:
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
    help: >
           Line one
           Line two
