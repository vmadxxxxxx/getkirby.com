Text: The image caption support is awesome, but wondering if there is a way (or planned way) to allow a user to add captions to images from the panel.  Would be very helpful for sites built for clients.

Also noticed that you can't upload plain text files to a page either.  So you're only able to add captions through FTP?

thanks!
