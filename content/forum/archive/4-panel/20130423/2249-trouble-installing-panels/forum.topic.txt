I've recently decided to build my portfolio in kirby, however, when i'm setting up the site on my local server (in XAMPP), I download the files from git, and follow the instructions and place the files in the correct areas in the folders, but when I refresh the page -- I get this error: 

Warning: require_once(C:xampphtdocs/kirby/lib/kirby.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in C:xampphtdocsgetkirbyindex.php on line 64

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'C:xampphtdocs/kirby/lib/kirby.php' (include_path='.;C:xamppphpPEAR') in C:xampphtdocsgetkirbyindex.php on line 64

Am I missing something horrifically obvious? 

Cheers in advance!
