Text: I uploaded kirby and the kirby panel to my nginx Test-Server, everything is working fine, but there is one Bug I found.

If you click the logout-button and the show:logout action is called I get a file named show-logout as a download and the session will not close.

My main rewrite is

    location /content {
        rewrite ^/content/(.*).(txt|md|mdown)$ /error redirect;
    }

    location /site {
        rewrite ^/site/(.*) /error redirect;
    }

    location /kirby {
        rewrite ^/kirby/(.*) /error redirect;
    }

    location /panel {
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
            rewrite ^/panel/(.*)$ /panel/index.php last;
            break;
        }
    }

    location / {
        if (!-e $request_filename) {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php last;
            break;
        }
    }

Does anyone experienced the same problem by using the Kirby Panel with nginx?
