Text: Here is a [multiselect field for Panel on GitHub...](https://github.com/shoesforindustry/kirbycms-panel-master/tree/master/fields) let me know how it works for you. 

In my Panel blueprint I used something like:

```php
  multiselect: 
    label: My multiselect 
    type: multiselect
    options:
       1: Option 1
       2: Option 2
       3: Option 3
    default: 2,3

```

In your content page file you might have something like this....

```
Title: Multiselect Field
----
Multiselect: 1,2

```
Sadly the formatting of the select boxes in Panel are not so good, but you can play with that ;-)
