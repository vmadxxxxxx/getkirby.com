Text: I'm pretty sure it is 
`
text/x-markdown
`
it is listed on [Shared Mime Info](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xdg/shared-mime-info/tree/freedesktop.org.xml.in#n5031)

``` 
<mime-type type="text/x-markdown">
    <_comment>Markdown document</_comment>
    <sub-class-of type="text/plain"/>
    <glob pattern="*.md"/>
    <glob pattern="*.mkd"/>
    <glob pattern="*.markdown"/>
 </mime-type>
```

I had a look at the mime types in the panel config.php and added 
`
text/x-markdown
`

I also had a look at *function mime_to_extension* in the **panel/lib/upload** file and added:

` 
'text/x-markdown' => 'md'
`

No luck, interestingly if you set your default **site/config** file type to *'md'* then you cannot see *'md'* files in the panel file list, even if you add them manually and set rights! However, if you change your default file type in **site/config** to *'txt'*, you can see then see the *'md'* files in panel files.

One for Bastian I think....
