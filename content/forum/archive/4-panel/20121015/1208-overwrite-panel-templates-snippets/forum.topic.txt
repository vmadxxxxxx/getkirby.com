Text: We are looking for a good method to overwrite the default panel snippets and template. What would be our best option?

The default panel snippets and templates are located in:

Root > Panel > Snippets
Root > Panel > Templates

We are looking for a method to overwrite them with site specifik templates and snippets when necessary. Normally placing a snippets and template folder like:

Root > Site > Panel > Snippets
Root > Site > Panel > Templates

would be the normal "Kirby way of working". But that doesn't overwrite the default snippets and templates.

Thanks!
