Text: Do you want to modify the panel design or implement new features? The problem is that I'm planning to build a new version of the panel which is based on a different framework/structure. The main reason for this is better extendability. So if you invest too much time in modifying the core, it will be impossible to update later. 

If you could describe some more what you want to achieve I might be able to give you some tips how to build that without messing with the core.
