Text: Ok, that's good to know :)

You can already develop your own custom form fields for the panel without having to edit the core. Check out a few examples over here: <https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/fields>

Custom fields can be added to site/panel/fields, so they don't go into the core panel folder. 

Unfortunately field development is not yet documented, but you can check out the default form fields in panel/fields to get even more information and you can have a look at the form class in panel/lib/form.php. The good thing about this way to extend the panel is that it won't change in the new version, so your extension won't break with updates. 

If you need more help with this, please send me an email: <bastian@getkirby.com>
