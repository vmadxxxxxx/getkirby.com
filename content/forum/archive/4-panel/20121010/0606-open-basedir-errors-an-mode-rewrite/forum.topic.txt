Text: Hello if I use rewrite for the URL I always get an OpenBaseDir error in the panel:

Warning: is_file(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/var/www/clients     ............  web/kirby/lib/helpers.php on line 15 

If I comment that line out  

if($uri && is_file(c::get('root') . '/' . $uri)) {
   return $baseUrl . '/' . $uri;          
}

The panel works fine but the frontend is broken.

If I switch on rewrite - the panel doesn't work any more.

Is there a way to fix the panel links?

Many thanks Tobias
