Text: I'm using MAMP to try Kirby and the Panel out locally and everything seems to be working fine up until now. The Panel installation worked fine until I got to Step 2 and it gave me the Login button. But when I click on it, it just refreshes the same page and nothing happens. Am I missing something?
