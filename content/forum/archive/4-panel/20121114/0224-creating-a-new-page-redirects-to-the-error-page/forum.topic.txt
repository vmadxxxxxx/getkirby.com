Text: Whenever I create a new page in the Kirby Panel, enter a title and hit save - it re-directs me to the 'error' page.

That is to say, not the http://mysite.com/error page, but the http://mysite.com/**panel**/error page. Where you can update the information on your _site's_ error page.

If I click the **Home** button to go back to the main panel screen I can see that my new page was created just fine... but this is definitely irritating (and I wouldn't want to hand over to a client with this happening).

Anyone else find this?
