Text: Hi folks,

For a while now... 6 months at least... on most of my Kirby projects, I always get kicked back to the login screen when using the Panel. It tends to be when I switch tabs, or focus away. Then, as soon as I hit 'Save' or navigate elsewhere, it just kicks me out to the login screen.

Any reason why this should be happening and how to avoid this?

Thanks,
R
