Text: I feel quite stupid for not getting this to work as nobody else seems to have this problem and it all really sounds so simple. 

The Panel Docs state: _"By default the editor can choose, which template to use for new subpages."_

I just don't get this to work. I created a new blueprint in site/panel/blueprints but when creating a new Page I get no option to pick this Template for the new Subpage. 

I changed the default blueprint and added "templates: review" - and fair enough, that template is taken for the creation of new subpages. But without putting it in there I don't see any way to choose it in the panel itself. 

What could I be doing wrong?
