Text: You might need to create a template for it as well - not just a blueprint?

So you should have both:

/site/templates/myTemplate.php
/site/panel/blueprints/myTemplate.php

If you don't specify a template field in the parent blueprint then you should get a list of all available templates to to choose from when creating a new page...

If you _do_ set the template field like so...

/site/panel/blueprints/myParentTemplate.php

title: Project Page
pages: true
template: myTemplate

...it will force any new pages, which I think you've already arrived at.

The only other option I can think of is if you want to only choose from a set of templates - which the documentation specifies to do this:

title: Project Page
pages: true
template: 
  - myTemplate
  - myOtherTemplate
  - etc


Hope that helps.
