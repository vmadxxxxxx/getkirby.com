We already did a test installation and Kirby is working great so they allow writing in the server to the apache user, no problem there.
I'm toying with the idea of hacking the Panel to include a page prepared with ACE ((link: http://ace.ajax.org/)) and some custom code to do the loading and saving.
Would be nice to be able to release it as a Plugin but the Documentation is pretty scarce so I don't know if I will be able to do it in a reasonable timeframe.
