Text: I just move my Kirby powered website online and the panel, that was working locally, is not working anymore. I got the following error:

``This web page has a redirect loop``

I checked the .htaccess file and every think looks ok. I tried to reinstall the panel from scratch (removed the all folders and download a new one), but I go the same error...

Any ideas why?
