I'm using the panel and am having an issue with date fields. In my blueprints, I have set my date fields to be 'date' and the format to either "yyyy" or "yyyy/mm/dd".

date:
  label: Date Published
  type:  date
  format: yyyy/mm/dd

When I focus the field, a date picker shows up (I think it's the jQuery UI one, not browser native). When I select a date, the year is repeated. For example, if I choose Dec 28, 2013 and format it as "yyyy/mm/dd", the field shows "20132013/12/28" after I select the date.

I see this behavior in both released and dev versions of the panel using Safari 7 (Mavericks) and Chrome. Anyone else see this issue and know of a fix?

Thanks.
