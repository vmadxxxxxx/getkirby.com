I'm having the same problem.
Everything is fine on MAMP. I've uploaded the site to the server and the site links work and I can see the first panel overview page. When I click on a page in the panel I get the 'error' page. 

If I upload the htaccess file from the root of my MAMP site into the root of my server site everything is exactly the same as above except I then get a server error instead of the error page. 

I've tried out loads of different settings in the config file (URL, subfolder and rewrite setups), none of which make any difference. My site is a sub-folder on the server which has been defined as an add on domain.

I don't know much about rewrites and htaccess so keep it simple please!

Thanks
