Text: Try in your  locally (non-subfolder) setup with
`RewriteBase /` in .htaccess and in config `c::set('subfolder', false);`

This assumes your PHP had mod_rewite available (most do), but you could also try `c::set('rewrite', false);` to trun of the mod re-writing for testing.

If not I suspect something else is not right, things not in the right place? You you list out your folders for your local install.
