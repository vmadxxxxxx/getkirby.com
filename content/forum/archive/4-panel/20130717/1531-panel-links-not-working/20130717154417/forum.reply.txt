Text: @russbaldwin my .htaccess file resides in my "site" subfolder where I installed Kirby, outside of kirbycms-panel. Should there be another .htaccess file within the Panel's folder?

To clarify, this is my folder structure:

public_html
 - site
   - .htaccess
   - assets
   - content
   - index.php
   - kirby
   - kirbycms-panel
   - site
   - thumbs
