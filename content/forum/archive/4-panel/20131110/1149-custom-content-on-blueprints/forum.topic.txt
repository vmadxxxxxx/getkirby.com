Text: Hi guys,
As far as I understand, in panel blueprints I can only choose among predefined sets of fields. I'm looking for an elegant solution to output custom content to blueprints and thus to content form.
Are there some solutions to I achieve this elegantly without messing around with core Kirby code? 

Thx
