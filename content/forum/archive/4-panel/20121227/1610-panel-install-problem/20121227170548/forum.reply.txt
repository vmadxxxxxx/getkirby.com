I found this super confusing the first few times I installed the Panel too.

When the configuration says to rename and move the defaults folder to the `site` folder, it **doesn't** mean the site *root*, it means the folder called `site` that comes with the default Kirby install. So your folders should look something like this:

assets
content
index.php
kirby
panel (the original panel folder as you downloaded it)
site
    → cache
    → config
    → panel (**used to be the defaults folder, now called panel and moved under `site`**)
    → plugins
    → snippets
    → templates

Maybe we should nudge Bastian to make this more clear.
