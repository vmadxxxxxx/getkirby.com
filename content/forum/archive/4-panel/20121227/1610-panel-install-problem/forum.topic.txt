Text: Hi,

I'm trying to install the panel, but can't get past this stage:

1. Step / Panel Configuration

To get your Kirby panel up and running, copy the "defaults" folder

…paste it into your site folder and rename it to "panel"

Whenever I do this, I get a server error as the panel install folder is getting replaced. If I just merge the folders then I'm stuck on this message. Presumably I'm doing something insanely stupid! 

Thanks,
J
