Text: I want to let people edit file meta through the panel
But I have a few fields… I can’t get them to show up.

This is my blueprint, but it doesn’t work nor does it work when I don’t indent the filefields line.

	title: Page
	files: true
	pages: true
		limit: 10
		sort: flip
		filefields: 
			title: 
			  label: Podcast title
			  type: text
			 speaker: 
			   label: Speaker name
			   type: text
			 description: 
			   label: Short description
			   type: text
			 date: 
			   label: Podcast Date
			   type: text
		       help: Format - YYYY-MM-DD
