Text: AFAIK, the only way to do it right now is to


- upload the image file to a page's file area
- embed the image using its filename


Within textareas, you can reference images by using the Kirbytext tag:

    (image: myawesomepicture.jpg)

This tag and its options is explained in more detail in [Text Formatting 101](http://getkirby.com/blog/text-formatting-101).
