Text: Hey there,

I'm looking for a developer for my portfolio site. It would be a fairly simple site with 4 separate layouts:

Portfolio Overview (thumbnails)
Portfolio Piece Detail
About Me
Blog

I've already coded a pretty big chunk of the responsive site using the Bootstrap framework, not sure if this would help you at all though.

I'm willing to pay or do web design work in exchange. Hit me up on Twitter if you're interested! @sethkasky

Thanks!
