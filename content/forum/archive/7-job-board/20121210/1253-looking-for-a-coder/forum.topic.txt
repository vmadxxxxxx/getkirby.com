Text: I would like to hire someone who likes to build a site for myself with kirby.

I am not a programmer but know my way around the latest web technologies and i have a clear vision of how the website should look like and function.

Please get in contact with me and tell me you what information you need to make an offer.

Thanks so much in advance!
Philipp

PS: I from munich germany, if by coincidence this is an information that helps you to get in contact with me ;)
