Text: I've not used the 'counter' but it looks like it stores json, so you should be able to read it from snippet/template code. Maybe some sort of clever folder structure and/or a combined array? Maybe using a 'filterby()'? Also maybe check out [Categories + Tags](http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:99) for some more ideas...
