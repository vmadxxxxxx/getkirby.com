Text: Hi folks,

Hope you are well and doing some kirby awesomeness.

I am in need to display articles by time range for top stories (top "N" month, top "N" week, top "N" day).

I am using Simple Kirby Like Counter.

It would be nice to have it in a way like website.com/top/top:all and website.com/top/top:month, etc.

Or as separate page website.com/top-all and website.com/top-month, etc.

Any ideas or hints to the right direction?

Thank you!
