Text: Hi everyone,

I try to groupBy pages.

For now, I get my page’s childrens then I sortBy them. In my loop that displays them, I watch the field value (that I used to sortBy), when it change, I add some HTML. But it’s a pretty ugly way. Plus, it doesn’t allow to sort groups by alphabetic title and the contents by date, for exemple…

```php
<? /* in the code bellow, $field is a param */ ?>
<? $sortValue = -1 ?>
<? $articles = $page->children()
                    ->visible()
                    ->sortBy($field)
                    ->flip()
                    ->paginate(15)
?>

<? foreach($articles as $article): ?>
  
  <? $currentSortValue = $article->$field() ?>

  <? if ( $condition = (string)$sortValue!=(string)$currentSortValue ): ?>

    <? $sortValue=$currentSortValue ?>

    <h2><?= $sortValue ?></h2>

  <? endif ?>

  <? snippet('teaser', array('article'=>$article) ) ?>

<? endforeach ?>
```

I found in the Kirby toolkit [collection::groupby](http://reference.new.getkirby.com/toolkit/classes/collection/methods/groupby) methode which seems to be perfect.
But I didn’t find if it’s possible to use it with the object Page in Kirby CMS.

Could anyone offer any advice? I would really appreciate it!
