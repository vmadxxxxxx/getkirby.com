Text: I have a noimage.jpg file in my assets/images folder to be used as a thumbnail for pages that do not have an image.

I'd like to be able to control the width/height of this thumbnail dynamically with the thumb() plugin so that it matches the thumbs generated for other pages.

<strong>I want to put my noimage.jpg file inside of assets/images</strong> and I can't seem to access those images with the thumb() plugin. 

<pre><code><?php thumb('assets/images/noimage.jpg', array('width' => 200, 'height' => 150)); ?></code></pre>

Here's the error I'm getting:
<pre><code>Fatal error: Call to a member function width() on a non-object in ...root/site/plugins/thumb.php on line 45</code></pre>

Any ideas? Thanks!
