Text: Figured it out. It was a dumb mistake on my end. I am automatically creating the folders from a Hazel action and the folder name is based on the title of my post. I forgot to clean up my dashes. I like to use en and em dashes in my titles and Hazel used those instead of a simple minus for the folder names.
