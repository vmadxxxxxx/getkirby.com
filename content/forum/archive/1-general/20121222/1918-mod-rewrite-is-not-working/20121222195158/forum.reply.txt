Text: When you installed Kirby, did you be sure to get move the .htaccess file along with all the other files and folders that comes with the defaults install?

There's an important line in Kirby's default .htaccess file which allows it to run in a subfolder:

    RewriteBase /path-to/your-project

I'd bet this line is where your problem lies.

Here's a tutorial on how to setup Kirby using MAMP: <http://getkirby.com/blog/mamp>
