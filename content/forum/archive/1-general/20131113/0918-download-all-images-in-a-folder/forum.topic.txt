Text: Hi Folks,

does anyone know a trick to implement the following:

- user clicks a link in the FE
- a .zip-file from all the images contained in the current page's folder is generated and download started

I know there is no

    <?php echo $page->files->create.zip(); ?>

but it would be awesome :)

Thank you for your answers!
