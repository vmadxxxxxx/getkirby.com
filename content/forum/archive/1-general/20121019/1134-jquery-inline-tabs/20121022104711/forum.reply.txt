Text: To have that right inside the text would involve very complexe regular expressions, which are very error prune. 

I'd suggest to work with invisible subpages instead, which don't actually create subpages, but those tabs instead. 

so your structure would be

```
page-with-tabs
  - page-with-tabs.txt
  - tab-1
    - tab.txt
  - tab-2
    - tab.txt
  - tab-3
    - tab.txt
```

and your page-with-tabs.txt template would then fetch all the tab subfolders and build the tabs html. 

The big advantage of this solution is that those tabs can become very complex with included images and all the other page-related features. 

Does that make sense to you? :)
