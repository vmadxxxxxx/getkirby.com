Instead of editing the existing vimeo tag I created my own video tag which I've set up to work with both vimeo and youtube.
<pre><code>(video: vimeo.com/79338229)</code></pre>
It doesn't include options for size because it comes with div wrapper and fluid width CSS.

The responsive CSS is from [Rapid Boostrap](http://niklausgerber.com/blog/rapid-bootstrap-v3/).
