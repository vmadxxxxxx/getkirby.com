Text: Sure I can live with a div. In most situations that would be the perfect fit. Looks ok to add the div to the default code. 

However, I was looking for a way to extend the vimeo function so I can rewrite what's returned by the default vimeo function in Kirby's kirbytext.php file.

Can anyone help with that?
