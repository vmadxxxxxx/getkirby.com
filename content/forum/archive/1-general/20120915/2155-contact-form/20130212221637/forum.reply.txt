Text: hi,

i have a problem with the contactform plugin.

i installed and setup.
after sending the thank you message displays, but the letter did not arrive.
MAMP on localhost from trying.

here are the settings contactform.php:
```
$form = new contactform(array(
  'to'       => 'kukac7@gmail.com',
  'from'     => 'Contact Form <contact@yourdomain.com>',
  'subject'  => 'New contact form request',
  'goto'     => $page->url() . '/status:thank-you'
));
```

what could be wrong?

thanks for your help!

**update**: works on the server.
