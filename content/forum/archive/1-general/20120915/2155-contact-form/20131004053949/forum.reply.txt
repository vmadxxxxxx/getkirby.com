Text: Hi all,

Is there any specific requirement or something to install/activate for sending with PHP mail function? I'm unable to send any email using this method.

I've tested the plugin using Postmark and it runs just fine. Will try Amazon SES soon. But i prefer to use the (free) native function.

Thx.
