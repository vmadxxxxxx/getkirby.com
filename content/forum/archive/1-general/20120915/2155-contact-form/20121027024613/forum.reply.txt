Text: I'm having trouble running this on my site.

When loaded i get the error message:

`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in .../site/plugins/contactform/contactform.php on line 23`

I'm on a shared hosting package with 123reg which is running PHP Version 5.2.16. It works fine on my local mamp server.

Any suggestions on how to fix this?

Thanks
