Text: I implemented the contactform plugin and for the most part, it works great.

Small issue though, it doesn't seem to use the 'contactform.mail.php' snippet properly.  It always defaults to the secondary $body definition listed in the 'contactform.php' plugin file.

Curious if this is a simple option I'm missing...

Thank you!
