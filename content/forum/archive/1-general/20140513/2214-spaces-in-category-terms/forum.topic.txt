Text: Are spaces allowed in category terms? I can't see any examples on this site that shows a category term with two or more words.

My new site won't be a film blog, but if it was I might want categories like this:

Film Noir
New releases
Action & Adventure
Oscar Winners

Is there any reason why this might not work?
