Text: If you want to output all your articles, you need to loop through the array to output all articles' titles:

    <?php
        foreach ($pages->index() as $p): ?>
            
           <li><?php echo $p->title() ?></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>

I'm not quite sure if you want the titles, though. If you want the folders, you can use $p->uid() instead.

If you just echo an array like above, your output is always the word "array".
