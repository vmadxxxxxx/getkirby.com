Text: Not sure if this is a kirby-bug, an error on my end or an actual feature. When displaying a file's url using `echo $page->files()->first()->url()`, does it really include the .txt file itself (the file where you write down your actual post) as a possible file to be displayed? Shouldn't the text file be automatically excluded from being a `file()`? Thanks :D
