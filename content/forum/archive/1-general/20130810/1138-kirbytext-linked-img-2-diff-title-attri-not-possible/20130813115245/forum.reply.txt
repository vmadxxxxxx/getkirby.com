Text: This doesn't help me. Perhaps because I am new to php.

My problem is here. In my script above I´ve:

```php
title: <?php echo html($page->title()) ?>
```
But this doesn't work because it displays the page title!
```php
title: <?php echo $image->title() ?>
```
This also does not work. I think because of the:
$imagelist= $page->imagelist();
...
foreach ($imagelistitem  as $image):

So how can I read the caption from the txt file when I use the imagelist? (Look above)
