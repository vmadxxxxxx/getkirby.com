Text: I'm making a template and trying to create a portfolio page where the images are displayed and they link to the page of each work page.


I have that down, but I want to display only an image named thumb.png. As it is, it displays all the images in that work.

here is my image code:

	 <?php foreach($article->images() as $image): ?>
            										
	<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><img src=<?php echo $image->url() ?>"/> </a>

			    <?php endforeach ?>
