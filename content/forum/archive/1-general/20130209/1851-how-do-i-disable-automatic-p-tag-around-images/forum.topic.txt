Text: Argh! Another thing related to resizing images. It appears Kirby automatically wraps all img tags with p tags. I have special styling on all of my paragraphs, which I don't want to apply to my images, but since all of my images get automatically wrapped in p tags the style gets applied. (max-width, by the way) Is there any way to have no p tags wrapped around images automatically?

edit: Disabling line breaks in the config file doesn't work either.

One of the "solutions" is to wrap a plain html img tag in a div. I really hope that's not the case
