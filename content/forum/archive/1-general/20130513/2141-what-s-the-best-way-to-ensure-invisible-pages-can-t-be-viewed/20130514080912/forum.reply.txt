Text: Only add the link if the 'next-page' is visible, maybe use some different text like 'Coming soon...' and don't call the page "quarter-after" - call it what it is - then they would have to know the actual chapter url? It is still obfuscation, but it is a bit better? 

Best and easiest would perhaps be not to post until ready or have different content showing perhaps a summary?

There could also be options with Apache .htaccess protected directories or maybe even some re-write stuff?
