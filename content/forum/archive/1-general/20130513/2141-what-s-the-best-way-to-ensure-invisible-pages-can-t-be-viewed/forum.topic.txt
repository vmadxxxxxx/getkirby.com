Text: I recently re-programmed my site using Kirby. The site is essentially an online book with chapters posted every other Monday. When you reach the last chapter there is a message that says something like, "Up Next: Chapter 9: Quarter After". From this it's easy to guess that the URL for that chapter will be "quarter-after" and just type it into the address bar. You can see a live example [here](https://amemoirproject.com/chapters/shirts-vs-skins) (scroll to the bottom).

Outside of manually obscuring the UID until that chapter is ready to be posted, is there a way to secure that address until it's visible?
