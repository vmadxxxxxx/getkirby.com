Text: Hey, just stumbled across your question, while looking for something else. I did that recently, hope it will help you—
Here’s how I solved it.

    <?php
    
    // I assume your cards are organised in subpages, let’s get them all.
    $cards = $page->children()->visible();

    // Now, let’s filter out all that will be published at a future date.
    $publishedcards = $cards;
    foreach( $publishedcards as $card )
        if( new DateTime( $card->publishdate() ) > new DateTime( "now" ) )
            $publishedcards = $publishedcards->not( $card->uid() );
    
    ?>

That’s it. Obviously you’ll have to include a date field in your card blueprint with the name _publishdate_.

Note to Bastian (in case you ever read this):
Please include Markdown/Kirbytext formatting indications for new replies right from the start. I just had to spend 15 minutes figuring out how to formate this lousy piece of code up there.
Thanks
