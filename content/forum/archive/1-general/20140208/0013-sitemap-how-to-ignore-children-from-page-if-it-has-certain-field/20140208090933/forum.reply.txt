Text: Not quite sure what you are trying to achieve, but maybe just two folders one with "text" field children and one with 'docs' children?
You can then 'ignore' from array.

If not maybe something like (you need to set the $key and $value) :
```php
$pages->find('folder')
      ->children()
      ->filterBy($key, $value)
```
