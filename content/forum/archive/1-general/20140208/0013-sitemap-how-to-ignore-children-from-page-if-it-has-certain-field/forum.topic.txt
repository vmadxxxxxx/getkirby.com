Text: Hello. I'm using the [default sitemap](http://getkirby.com/blog/xmlsitemap) and I have this visible page called "folder" which holds several "child" folders. All "child" folders have the same template, but they or have a "text" field or a "docs" field.

I want to **ignore** all "child" from "folder" which HAVE the "docs" field (or that lacks the "text" field) in my sitemap.

Ideas? I don't know how to convert all the children into an array and how to avoid them before generating the sitemap. `findByDir()`, perhaps? I don't know.
