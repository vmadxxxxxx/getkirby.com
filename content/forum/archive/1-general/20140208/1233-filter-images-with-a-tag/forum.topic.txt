Text: Hi. I wanted to create an index page which lists all tags from a certain field. By using the tagcloud plugin, I was able to achieve this without any problems, however, I'd like to "prettify" the output by replacing the placeholder image in my code with an image from a post. So, in addition to displaying the name and the results for a tag, I also want to search through all posts with that tag, pick a random image and output the url of it. Sadly, I have no idea what would be the best way to do this, or if it is even possible, so any help would be really appreciated.

Current code:
<?php snippet('header') ?>

	<?php

	$photographs = $pages->find('shots');
	$tags = tagcloud($photographs);

	?>

	<div id="page-wrapper">
		<div id="content">
		  <?php foreach($tags as $tag): ?>	  		
		  	<div class="tagbox">
				<a href="<?php echo $tag->url() ?>">
					<img src="http://placehold.it/400x400">
					<div class="caption-wrapper">
						<?php echo $tag->name() ?> </br>
						<?php echo $tag->results() ?> <?php if ($tag->results() == '1'): ?>image<?php else: ?>images<?php endif ?>		        
					</div>
				</a>
		  	</div>
		  <?php endforeach ?>
		</div>
		<?php snippet('footer') ?>
	<div>

Basic structure:

    content/
        01-photos/
            01-title/
            	photograph.txt
            	image.jpg
            02-title/
            	photograph.txt
            	image.jpg
