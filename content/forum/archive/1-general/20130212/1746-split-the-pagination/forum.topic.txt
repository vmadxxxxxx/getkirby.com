Text: Hi,

I want to set the previous button on another position than the next button in the page navigation but without "position: absolute;" 
Is there a way to do the following:

*HEADER*
**Previous button**

article
article
article

**Next button**
*FOOTER*

I hope someone can help me with this problem!
Thanks,

Giel
