Text: That's no problem, because the public name of the page is not related to the template it will use.  Kirby will look for a template that has the same name as the file's content text file.

So you can just name your text files like this:

/product/product-a/**template-a.txt**
/price/product-a/**template-b.txt**

And in your template folder, you create both a template-a.php and a template-b.php which will be used by these pages.
