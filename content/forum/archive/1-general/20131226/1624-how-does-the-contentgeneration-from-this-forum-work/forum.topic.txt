Text: Hi,
how is realised the frontend content addition here in the forum.
I thing about how can I create content directly from the kirby website without the Panel.

Actually I wrote a guestbook which is generating files normal through PHP with fopen, fwrite etc.
But now I thing about it if there is a smarter way, especially for KirbyCMS.

Greetings
