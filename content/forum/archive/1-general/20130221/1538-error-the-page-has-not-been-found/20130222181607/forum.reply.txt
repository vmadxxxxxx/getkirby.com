Text: I will fiddle around abit with my setup tonight, i already set the subfolder in config.php as stated above and i have a redirection in the htaccess file.
Maybe the way i want to do it just isnt possible.

Update: I got an answer from Bastian, seems i had a wrong understanding of how to use kirby in general.

"The current version of Kirby depends on the index.php being named index.php. That's why indexy.php breaks the site. 

But in your case you should just put the entire installation into a stuff subfolder. Afterwards you should be able to open your site with 
http://localhost/stuff where it will be entirely independent from your other site. You might need to adjust the rewrite base in your htaccess though. 

I hope this helps. 
Cheers, Bastian"

Case closed :P
