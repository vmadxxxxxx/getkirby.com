Text: Hi,
I am having issues with kirby on xampp:
I put all the kirby stuff inside a folder called blog, inside my root folder.
When i open my index.php in /blog everything is fine. I copied the index.php
and put it into my root folder, named it indexy.php, and i get the "page not found error" for the homepage, the menue works fine.

In indexy i changed the paths to /blog/kirby /blog/site and /blog/content

In the config.php i have my url set to 'http://localhost/blog'
I set the subfolder to 'blog'

When i set troubleshoot to true everything seems fine in indexy and index.
The strange thing is, when i change the filename from indexy.php to index.php it is working like it should. Can anyone help me with this?
I just want to have kirby in a subfolder and pull stuff form there into my main site in the root folder.
