Besides that I think want you would like to display, we did something the same, we used the 1st listed code at the fun with menus page, http://getkirby.com/blog/fun-with-menus and also wrapped it in a drop down for several pages. We used it for series, you want to us it for categories.

Maybe you could make a copy of the tagcloud, adjust it to you parameters, in this case categories, save it as catcloud or whatever you like refer to it in your blog.

You could also use the alphabetise plugin http://getkirby.com/forum/code-snippets/topic:419 to display your categories, your visitors can directly see how many articles there are in a certain category 

Good luck!
