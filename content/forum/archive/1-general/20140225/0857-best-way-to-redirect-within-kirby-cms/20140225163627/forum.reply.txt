Text: Perhaps if it is a permanent re-route then add it to your **.htaccess** file?
I've not tested the code below, and I'm not sure it is what you want, but I hope you get the idea.

```
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^mysite.com/projects/$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^mysite.com/projects/(.*)$ http://mysite.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```
