Text: I need the following redirect:

> http://mysite.com/projects/a-project ======>  http://mysite.com/a-project

As of now in order to achieve this, I've put the following code at the very top of my header snippet:

    <?php  
    if ( $site->uri()->path(1) == 'projects' ) 
        go($site->url().'/'.$site->uri()->path(2)); 
    ?>

My question: is this the best way to do this? Is there perhaps a more logical place to place this code than in the header snippet?  In the config file for example?
