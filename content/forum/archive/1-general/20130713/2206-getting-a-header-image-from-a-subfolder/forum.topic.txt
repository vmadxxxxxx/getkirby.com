Text: I've been using this snippet to find a header image in a current folder of the page (using it in a blog):

~~~
<?php if ($page->hasImages() && $page->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', 'header')->first()): ?>
    <?php $image = $page->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', 'header')->first() ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>">
<?php endif ?>
~~~

And now I'm building a blog-page which loops all my posts and want to add the header-image to the list of posts. I think it might got something to do with the ->hasChildren() function but I just can't seem to get it working! What do I need to add to make it work?
