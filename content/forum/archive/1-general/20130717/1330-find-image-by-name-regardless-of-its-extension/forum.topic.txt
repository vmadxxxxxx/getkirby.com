Text: I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to return the URL of an image with a specific _name_ (e.g. "thumb").

I'm currently using

	$i->images()->find('thumb.jpg')->url()

but that way of course, images with a different extension (.png for instance) would be ignored.

I also want to avoid creating an extra text file for each thumb, so I could filter by title.

Does anyone have an idea how I could achieve this?
