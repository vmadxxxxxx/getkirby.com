Text: Mmmm, I was stumped until I realised it was the folder that was causing the lack of object error. The names for each folder are different in different languages ;-) So something like this would work.(You should probably tidy this code it up!)

```php
  <?php if(!$page->url_key()) {
    $findkey="article";
  }else{
    $findkey=$page->url_key();
  }?>
  <?php $articles = $pages->find($findkey)
                          ->children()
                          ->visible()
                          ->sortBy('date', 'desc')
                          ->paginate(5);?>
```

I see Bastian beat me to it with a better solution :(
