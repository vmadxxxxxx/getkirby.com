Text: When I create blogposts, they often show up multiple times in my RSS feed. I'm guessing this is because they are being posted immediately as soon as I save (which I tend to do a few times).

Is there a way to 'delay' the RSS feed, so it only picks up the final version of the post? Or should I just stop editing my posts 'live'? :)

Thanks!
