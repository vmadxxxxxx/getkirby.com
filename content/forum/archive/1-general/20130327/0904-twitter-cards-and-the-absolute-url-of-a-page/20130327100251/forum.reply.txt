Text: I think I see your point. My concern was that in some way it might affect a page’s ranking in Google if there are two versions, the one with `/blog/article-name` and the one with `/article-name`.

But, as `/blog/article-name` is automatically redirecting to `/article-name`, maybe I shouldn’t be worrying.
