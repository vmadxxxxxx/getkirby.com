Text: Maybe better off with gzip compression, pre-make thumbs using the method I mentioned earlier and HTML cache? 

I don't have any experience of XCache/eAccelerator, but as it generating the thumbs which is causing your problem I'm not sure they would help? Using Kirby caching will do a lot of what these do anyway (I think?).
