Text: Hi, 

I have on the homepage for my projects a cover.png. I show these with the following code:

    		<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>"><img src="<?php echo $article->images()->find('cover.png')->url(); ?>" class="hires" /></a>

My problem is that the extension isn't always png. Is there a way to get the extension of the cover image automatically? So it can be cover.gif of cover.png.

Thanks a lot!
