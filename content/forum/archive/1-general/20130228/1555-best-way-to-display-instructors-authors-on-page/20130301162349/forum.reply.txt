Text: Although Kirby works out-of-the-box, if you want to do some more complex stuff, you are going to need some PHP,HTML,CSS and probably Javascript skills.

Good news is Kirby makes quite a bit of the PHP stuff easy ;-)

Assuming something like the layout below and only one image per instructor as we are only pulling out the first (you can do it other ways.)
```
- content
    - instructors
        - 01-instructor
           - instructor.txt
           - instructor.jpg
        - 02-instructor
           - instructor.txt
           - instructor.jpg   
```

Then some template code maybe something like:

```php
<h3>Image loop of Instructors children - 
getting first image in Instructor child folder<h3>
  <ul><!-- Start of list -->
   <!-- Get instructors children pages
        & put it in $instructor -->
   <?php foreach($pages->find('instructors')
                        ->children()
                        as $instructor):?>

   <!-- Loop through $instructor making a list out of 
        instructor images and title -->
   <li>
    <img src="<?php echo $instructor->images()
                                    ->first()
                                    ->url() ?>" 
       alt="<?php echo html($instructor->title()) ?>" />
    <br/>
    <?php echo html($instructor->title()) ?>
   </li>
 <?php endforeach ?>
</ul><!-- End of list -->
```
How does that sound?
