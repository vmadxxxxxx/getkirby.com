Text: @russbaldwin That's perfect! Thank you Russ. Appreciate it. I had a hunch it was somewhere along the lines of a 'foreach' and some 'find', but I wasn't sure how to go about it. I'll give @plartz's code another try as well. I used this tweaked version of your example (with some CSS tweaking):

    <?php foreach($pages->find('instructors')->children() as $instructor):?>
        <img width="80" src="<?php echo $instructor->images()->first()->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($instructor->title()) ?>" />
    <?php endforeach ?>

Here's what it looks like now: (link: http://files.baderkamal.com/image/450n1d2W2v0O)

Just wondering how I'd go about linking the instructors' names from workshop.txt to pull the corresponding images from the instructor's folders.
