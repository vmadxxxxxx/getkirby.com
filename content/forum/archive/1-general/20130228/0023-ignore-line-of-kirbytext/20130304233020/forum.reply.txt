Text: The problem with the method @russbaldwin shows above (using spaces) is that when someone else follows your example they'll include spaces and it won't work.

After working on this for a bit, I came up with this solution:

    <pre>&#40;image: image.svg class: svg&#41;</pre>

So basically, instead of indenting you use the standard html "pre" tags, and then you use the HTML entities for open and close parenthesis. That leaves you with this result:

<pre>&#40;image: image.svg class: svg&#41;</pre>
