Text: Hi everybody.
I have a question for all of you.
How do you bump an older blog post after it has been updated without modifying the original post date?

#### Example:
You created a blog post 6 months ago and you have some news on the subject.
So you edit this post, you might change the headline to [Update]Title.
How do you get it to show on the first page so everybody sees there's an update - but on the other hand they know you posted the original topic 6 months ago?
