Text: I'm wondering what would be the most flexible way to handle different format images on one page.

For instance:
- a large cover image
- several smaller images

Ideal would be something like:

$page->files()->findInName("cover");
$page->files()->findInName("detail");

Thus some string matching on the filename. My PHP skills are a bit rusty but since there is no findInName() method, a foreach loop with a preg_match() within might work, no?
