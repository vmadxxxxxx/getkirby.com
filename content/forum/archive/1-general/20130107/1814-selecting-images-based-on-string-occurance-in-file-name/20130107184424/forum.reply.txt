Text: Look at the blog article about version 1.1.1 (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/1-1-1)

Basically, you need the new filterBy() functionality mentioned there.

    // get a list of projects, with the title containing the string "Project"
    $filtered = $pages->find('projects')
        ->children()
        ->filterBy('title', '*=', 'Project');
