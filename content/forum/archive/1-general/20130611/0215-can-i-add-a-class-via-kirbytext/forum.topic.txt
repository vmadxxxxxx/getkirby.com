Text: Is it possible to pass a class into an h1 element, for instance, using kirbytext?

Something like this?

title: #My Page Title (class:zing)

I know about the 'html' alternative (to 'kirbytext'), but using 'kirbytext' would make my Markdown strategy in my content much simpler. Just wondering. 

Thanks!
