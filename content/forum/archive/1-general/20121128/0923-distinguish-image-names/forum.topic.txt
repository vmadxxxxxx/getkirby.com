Text: Hi folks.

I need to grab only one image from a list of uploaded images to use it as a background page and the others as a gallery.
There will be two kinds of images for each articles: one with an alphabetical name, the others with a numéric name for the gallery.

Is there a simple code to distinguish the image names in order to retrieve the link?

Currently I use this code based on the first image which is not good enough for my purpose (the "first" could be use for the gallery):

    <?php if($page->hasImages()): ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $page->images()->first()->url(); ?>" alt="-" id="full-bg" />
    <?php else: ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $site->url() ;?>/img/default-bg.jpg" alt="-" id="full-bg" />
    <?php endif ?>

Thanks by advance for your help.
Cheers,
Patrick.
