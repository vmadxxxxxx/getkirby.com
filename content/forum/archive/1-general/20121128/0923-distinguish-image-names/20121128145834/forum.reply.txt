Text: Absolutely.

    <img src="<?php echo $page->images()->find('filename.png')->url(); ?>" alt="-" id="full-bg" />

And if you really want to put something useful in that alt tag, include a text file of filename.png.txt with a Title: field and do something like this.

    <?php $background = $page->images()->find('filename.png'); ?>
    <img src="<?php echo $background->url(); ?>" alt="<?php echo $background->title(); ?>" id="full-bg" />

You can of course include a conditional with a default that triggers if a file of that name doesn't exist. I use this method to check for header images on pages, and if one doesn't exist I just leave it out.
