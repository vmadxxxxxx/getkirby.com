Text: I'm looking at the simplest (important) way to make my install of Kirby responsive. I have a couple of links from Bastian, to CSS grids and Twitter Bootstrap, but I really need some pointers on where I should start.

I've coded sites, but am a little unsure of what I need to do to change my standard install into a responsive one. After that, I can edit and tinker away happily.

Any help most welcome.

Thanks!
