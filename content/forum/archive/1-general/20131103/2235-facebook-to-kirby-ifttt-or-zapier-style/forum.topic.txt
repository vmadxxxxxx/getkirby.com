Text: Hi
I'd like to create an automated task that creates a new entry on my kirby-powered site whenever I post something new on my Facebook wall or Facebook page. 

I'm just wondering which is the easier way to accomplish that. I took a look to IFTTT or Zapier, and they do some little nice tricks that could be useful, but I didn't find the complete solution (which is the one that won't require my intervention). 

Thank you
Francesco
