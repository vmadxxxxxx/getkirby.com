Text: Hello, again.

I've configured blogarticle.php with the entire lastest post of the blog. (Each post is in a visible subfolder with a txt named article.txt).

May be you can give some help.

First of all I've included prevnext extension to this page, but, like It is actually a page (main page of the blog), when I click in 'older posts' button it shows me 'Contact' (previous page) and not previous post.
I want this:
1 When somebody arrives to the site, Kirby opens the blog (not the index.php). (got it!)
2. Blog shows one entire post (not a list of lastest ones). (got it, but I don't know if I've got it in the right way).
3. Buttons to navigate previous posts, not previous pages. (pending)

Thanks a lot for helping me!
:-)
