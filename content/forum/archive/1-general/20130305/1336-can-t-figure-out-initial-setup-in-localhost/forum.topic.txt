Text: So here's some info, I'm running a LAMP-server on Ubuntu. I copied over the files to /var/www/ to a folder called /kirby. 

When I navigate to localhost/kirby, the index page shows up but if I click on a link it says that the page is not found.

So I went in to the config.php and tried to adjust the values but I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Here's the values I set in config.php:
c::set('url', '/');
c::set('subfolder', '/kirby');

I also set: RewriteBase /kirby

The index page shows up with those values but links to the subpages still won't work.

I've also tried c::set('url', false); and every other combination I could think of

Please help me out dudes/dudettes!
