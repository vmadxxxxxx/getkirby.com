Text: Is there a way to write a relative link in KirbyText? I often need to link to a subfolder. In HTML i'd simply write

    <a href="subfolder">text</a>

Or if I had to link to a subfolder in an adjacent folder I'd write:

    <a href="../adjacent/subfolder">text</a>

I don't want to write the full path as seen from the site root. So far that's the only way documented. But I guess I'm missing something here?

    <a href="/blog/articles/subfolder">text</a>
