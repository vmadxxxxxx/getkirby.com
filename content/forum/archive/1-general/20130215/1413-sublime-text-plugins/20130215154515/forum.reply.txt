Text: I don't think there are any Kirby plugins for code-completion or a snippet collection, but you mostly don't write code in Kirby itself, you may well write Markdown/KirbyText but that is pretty simple and you can get the Panel editor to have some buttons to help.

If you mean can you get plugins for Sublime that are useful, you can of course for get Markdown, PHP, JavaScript and CSS plugins and [many more...](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/community).
