Text: I'm currently building a one-pager site in a similar way to http://getkirby.com/blog/one-pager and I'm having trouble fetching the images of a project for a slider, my file structure is as follows:

04-projects > 01-projectA , 02-projectB etc. > Slides > 01.jpg , 02.jpg etc.

Can anyone tell me how I would fetch all images in the slides folder for each project?
