Text: I want to list the three latest articles at the foot of each main article page. So far I have the following code:

    <h2>You might also be interested in…</h2>
    <ul>
    <?php foreach($pages->find('blog')->children()->visible()->flip()->limit(3) as $article): ?>
    <li><a href="<?= $article->url() ?>"><?= html($article->title()) ?></a></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
   </ul>

But when the article being viewed happens to be one of the latest three articles I would like to exclude it from the list. I assume there’s something like ‘hide if current url’, but can’t figure out the correct syntax.
