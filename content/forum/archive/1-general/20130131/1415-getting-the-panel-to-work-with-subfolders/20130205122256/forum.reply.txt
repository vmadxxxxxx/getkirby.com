I just like to separate stuff into folders :)

@bastianallgeier

If I do that, I get `/atest/contact` in my links, instead of `/contact`.

I want Kirby in a subfolder, but I want to access it via `/` - not `/subfolder/`.

Following the instructions I found in another post ( http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:244 ) and outlined in my initial post at the top of this page, I can get Kirby running fine using this method. But the Panel doesn't work ... it just goes into a loop of death.
