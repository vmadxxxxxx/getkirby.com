Text: Sorry for the hassle but you completely went the wrong way. 
If you want to set the subfolder in your config it should look like this: 

```
c::set('subfolder', 'atest');
```

But normally just leave that with "false" and adjust the RewriteBase like this: 

```

RewriteBase /atest

```

Make sure to just use Kirby's htaccess and not an additional file. 

I hope this helps.
