Text: Let's say I have a fresh installation of Kirby, in a subfolder:

    root
        subfolder
            assets
            content
            kirby
            site
            index.php
            .htaccess

I create a new .htaccess in the root:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /subfolder/$1

I set the following line in config.php

    c::set('subfolder', '/');

Great - everything works. I can click around the demo site, no problem.

Next, I install the panel:

    root
    .htaccess <-- (.htaccess added to root)
        subfolder
            panel <-- (panel added to subfolder)
            assets
            content
            kirby
            site
            index.php
            .htaccess

I browse to /panel to complete the installation, but get the following error in Chrome ...

    /panel/error

    This web page has a redirect loop
    The web page at /panel/error has resulted in too many redirects.

I've been banging my head on this one for two hours now... PLEASE HELP :)
