Text: I maybe missing something but I just set up a quick test installing Kirby with a default *.htaccess* at:  
*http://localhost/atest*

```
root
    atest
        assets
        content
        kirby
        panel
        site
        .htaccess
        index.php
```

In *config.php* I changed:

```php
/* 
---------------------------------------
Subfolder Setup
---------------------------------------
Kirby will automatically try to detect the subfolder
i.e. http://yourdomain.com/subfolder
This might fail depending on your server setup. 
In such a case, please set the correct subfolder here. 
You must also set the right url then:
c::set('url', 'http://yoururl.com/subfolder');
if you are using the .htaccess file, make sure to 
set the right RewriteBase there as well:
RewriteBase /subfolder
*/
c::set('atest', true);
/*
```

Changed my .htaccess (it is in the *atest* subfolder)

```php 
# Set the RewriteBase to:
RewriteBase /atest
```

I can go to 
http://localhost/atest/panel/ with no problem?

You could also use your webservers' virtual host facility to set up a domain to point to the folder, which is what I would normally do.
