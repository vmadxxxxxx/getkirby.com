Text: Hiya,

For a slideshow (Juicebox.net) I need the name of a configuration file. The file "config.xml" exists in the slideshow folder, but when I refer to "config.xml" in my template (located in the /site/templates/ folder), I get an error message that the file doesn't exist.

So, I try to get the filename programmatically, something like:
  configUrl: '<?php $configfile = $page->files()->find('config.xml'); echo $configfile; ?>',
but that doesn't return the filename but the entire URL (i.e. a href plus description, as literally shown below) of that file in such a way:
  configUrl: '<a href="http://hostname.com/content/02-slideshows/lipf2008/config.xml">http://hostname.com/content/02-slideshows/lipf2008/config.xml</a>',

Apparently, something is wrong.
Does anybody have any idea?

Thanks in advance,
Stephan Jaeger
