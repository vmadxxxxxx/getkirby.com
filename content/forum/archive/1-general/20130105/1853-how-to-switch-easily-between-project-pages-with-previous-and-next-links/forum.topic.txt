Text: Hi all,

First a little warning, I'm a newby...(on kirby and PHP)

I'm building a website based upon Bastian's "one-pager" tutorial.
So far so good, I've build the one-pager, but from the project-thumbnails I go to a specific 'project' page (so this is no One-Pager after all...).
On this project page I want to be able to go to the next or previous project without going to 'home' first. So I want previous and next links (buttons), but how to accomplish this. I really have no idea... I'm more of a designer then a coder.

Any help would be (very) much appreciated.
