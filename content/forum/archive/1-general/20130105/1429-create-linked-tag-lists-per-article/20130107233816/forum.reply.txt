Text: I did this with categories. Didn't bother with tags, but it's the same thing.

    <?php if (param('category')) { ?>
        <h1>Blog <small>: <?php echo urldecode(param('category')) ?></small></h1>
    <?php } ?>

Now you may notice that this will just give you a lowercase version, but you can use this CSS to fix that:

    text-transform: capitalize;
