Text: Well yes I have but I beg to differ.

I personally find PHP templates messy and see a big advantage in using languages such as (link: http://slim-lang.com/ text: Slim) or (link: http://jade-lang.com/ text: Jade). I have worked with both approaches and know what I prefer. But I like most other aspects of Kirby a lot, which is why I have spent this effort at making Jade available in Kirby.

The Jade templates actually get translated to PHP templates and are cached as files, so speed wise there should be almost no difference.

The result works really well for me, which is why I wanted to share it with the community.

For reference, here the translated templates from the default Kirby example:

_main.jade

    !!! 5
    html
      head
        title #{$site->title()} - #{$page->title()}
        meta(charset="UTF-8")
        meta(name="description", content=html($site->description()))
        meta(name="keywords", content=html($site->keywords()))
        meta(name="robots", content="index, follow")
        link(rel="stylesheet", href=url("assets/styles/styles.css"))
      body
        header
          h1
            a(href=url())
              img(src=url("assets/images/logo.png"), width="115", height="41", alt=$site->title())
        include _menu
        include _submenu
        section.content
          block content
        footer!= kirbytext($site->copyright())

_menu.jade

    nav.menu
      ul
        each $p in $pages->visible()
          li
            a(class=$p->isOpen() ? 'active' : '', href=$p->url())= $p->title()

_submenu.jade

    $open = $pages->findOpen()
    $items = $open ? $open->children()->visible() : false
    if $items && $items->count()
      nav.submenu
        ul
          each $item in $items
            li
              a(class=$item->isOpen() ? 'active' : '', href=$item->url())=$item->title()

default.jade

    extends _main

    block content
      article
        h1!= html($page->title())
        != kirbytext($page->text())
