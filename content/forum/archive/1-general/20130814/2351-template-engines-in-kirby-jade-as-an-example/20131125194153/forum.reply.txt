Text: This intrigues me. I generally agree with the approach Kirby takes in comparison to systems that use a templating language that limits what you can do with your PHP, but if jade could be used without sacrificing that flexibility then I'm all ears.

I'm not entirely sure I'm sold on Jade, though, but I've used it on some Node.js projects, and I think I'm getting used to it.
