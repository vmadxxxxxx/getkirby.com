Text: I have a folder structure like so:
-product1
--product.jpg
--product.jpg.txt
--product.pdf
-product2
--product.jpg
--product.jpg.txt
--product.pdf
etc...

The goal is that when you click on the image, it will link to the corresponding pdf (which seems simple, but has been harder than I first thought). 

My current solution:
$imageLink = $page->children()->images()->first()->url();
$pdfLink = trim($imageLink, '.jpg');

This gets the full url of the image, minus the extension. After that I concatenated $imageLink with '.pdf' - which works (hurrah!), but seems kind of hacky. Can you think of a better way to do this?
