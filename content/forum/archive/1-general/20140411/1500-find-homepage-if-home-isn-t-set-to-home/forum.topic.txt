Text: Hey folks,

I usually get elements from the homepage like this:

    $images = $pages->find('home')->images()

How can I search for elements inside my home folder, if the homepage is set to another folder ('blog' or whatever) inside the config.txt?

Something like

    $images = $site->HomePage()->images()

would be great, but that isn't working.

Thanks, Christian
