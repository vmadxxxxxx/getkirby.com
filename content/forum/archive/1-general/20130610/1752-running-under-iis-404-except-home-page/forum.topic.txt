Text: Trying to see if Kirby works on our college IIS 7 setup. I'm getting Error 404 on all but home page. Things in play:
- IIS 7.0 on Windows Server 2008
- currently have Wordpress site running fine but Kirby is on Dropbox shared to the server and mapped as localhost:81
- PHP ver 5.2.14
- URL Rewrite 2.0 (installed from Microsoft)

Things I've tried:
- amended PHP.ini to include mbstring.dll reference
- set c::set('rewrite', false); but while this does let me see further pages, they are without styles (can't find styles.css, I reckon)
- installed URL Rewrite 2.0 but don't know what rules to add to please Kirby

Feel I'm close - think I mostly need the rewrite rules to make Kirby _find_ the sub-pages,

Loving Kirby so far, IIS - not so much ;)
