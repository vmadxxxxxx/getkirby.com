Well, as it is, you cannot even put your templates in subfolders because Kirby wouldn't find them.

An easy way to achieve this I can think of is 

- create a basic "empty" template called projects.php
- create several snippets that contain the content of the sub templates (01.php, 02.php etc.)
- call the snippets within projects.php randomly
