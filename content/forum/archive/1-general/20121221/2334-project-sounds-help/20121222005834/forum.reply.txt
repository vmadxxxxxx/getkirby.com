Text: Hey Lulezi,


I have tried the above code but nothing is being returned.

     <?php $projects = $pages->find('audio')->children()->visible() ?>
     <?php foreach($projects as $project): ?>
     <li class="item two-thirds column">
     <a href="<?php echo $project->url() ?>"><?php echo $project->title() ?></a> / 
     <?php foreach($project->sounds() as $sound) {$path = $sound->url();}?>
     </li>
     <?php endforeach ?>

The only other way i have been able to get it to work correctly is by modifying the kirby source files but i'd prefer a way without having to do this if possible.

The above code is correct isnt it?
