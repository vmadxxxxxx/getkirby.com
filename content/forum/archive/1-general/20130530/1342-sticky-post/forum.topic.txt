I'm making a blog with Kirby and wonder if it is possible to have sticky posts. They are just like normal posts the only difference is that they stay at the top as long as they turned "on". It has to be something the user can turn "off" or "on" again. When the post is "on" he will be displayed in another div than all the other posts. When the user turns the post "off" the post get back to normal and will be showed like the rest of the posts. I hope my sketch make it clear:
