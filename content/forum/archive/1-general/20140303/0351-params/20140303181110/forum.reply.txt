Text: I think the rewrite config just lets you remove the index.php.

There are two different things working in that article: URI path segments, and URL parameters. The parameters take the form `param:value`. The article says to access them using a full `$site->uri()->params()`, but I've never done that.

I just use `param('param-name')`. Maybe you'd use the whole `$site->uri()->params()` thing if you need to loop through them or something?

So if your URL is something like `http://foo.com/bar/filter:news` you could get the value of the page parameter like so:

```php
<?php echo param('filter') ?>
```

Which would of course echo `news`.
