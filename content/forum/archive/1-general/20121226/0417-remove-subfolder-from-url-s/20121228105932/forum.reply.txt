Text: Create a .htaccess file in your web root so it looks like that:

```
.htaccess <<- This one!
v3
  .htaccess
  assets
  content
  kirby
  site
```

Add these lines to it:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /v3/$1
```

You also have to change a line (normally line 74) in your `site/config/config.php` file to override the subfolder setting:

```
c::set('subfolder', '/');
```

The question is: Do you really need the subfolder - you can also move your whole Kirby website to your site root, can't you?
