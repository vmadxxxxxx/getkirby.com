Text: I could imagine using the solution above.

Imagine your main site and blog and perhaps some other stuff is contained within Kirby, but you still have some other non-Kirby stuff placed in your root folder, like a quick html mockup or a simple web app you made - then things could get messy.

	/
	.htaccess
	awesomeapp
	   inc
	   img
	   ajax.php
	   index.php
	kirby
	   .htaccess
	   assets
	   content
	   kirby
	   site
	mockup123.psd

I think it would be more "clean" to organize like that.
