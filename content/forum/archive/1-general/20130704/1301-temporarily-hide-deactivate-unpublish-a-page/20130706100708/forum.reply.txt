Text: I still think it would be best to make unpublished invisible and make your published items visible. Then add a menu post boolean to show or not show in the menu (as well as the invisible thing).

Simplest is if you don't want to publish it - don't put it on your web server, not sure why you want to publish/unpublish and what you mean by that?
