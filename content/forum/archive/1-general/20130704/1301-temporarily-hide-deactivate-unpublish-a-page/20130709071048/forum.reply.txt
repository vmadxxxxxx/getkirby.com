If you're trying to post something invisibly, without getting indexed, it sure does sound like something that shouldn't be in production. It's an oxymoron; it needs to be online in a published format, but hidden and not able to be crawled by search engines.

It seems like a problem on the content side. You could also restrict it by IP address:

<?php
//This function returns True if visitor IP within allowed range.
//Otherwise it returns False
function CheckAccess()
{
  //allowed IP range start, change it to yours
  //please note that $toip must be greater than $fromip

  $fromip = '127.0.0.1';

  //allowed IP range end

  $toip = '127.0.0.100';

  $ip = ip2long($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);

  return ($ip >= ip2long($fromip) && $ip <= ip2long($toip));

}
