Text: Ok am struggling with just getting the tag results. 

Here's a pen of the /people page.

The letters are appearing, but when I click on one no results get displayed. How do I make the results display when I click on a tag? 

I've read the tutorial on tags and there's nothing there about how to display the results of the tags...
