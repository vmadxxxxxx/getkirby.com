Text: This might be a little tedious to set up, but the way I picture this is something like this:

1. Have an array with all characters in the alphabet.
2. Compare that to the first letter of the last name and only link ones that actually have a result (probably just use a PHP string function to grab the first letter of the last name for comparison as you're looping through the names instead of a tag, because that means less work for whoever is entering the names).
3. Since clicking a letter should show you everybody who's last name begins with that letter, I'd say set up your search results page to look for a URL parameter and pull in all posts where the first letter of the last name matches the letter in that parameter.
4. The same search results page could also look for the search parameter and perform a full search if that parameter exists instead of the letter parameter.

I tried to find documentation on how to use URL parameters and didn't find it. I'm sure it's on here somewhere, maybe in a blog article. Or maybe it's just a part of some larger documentation piece.
