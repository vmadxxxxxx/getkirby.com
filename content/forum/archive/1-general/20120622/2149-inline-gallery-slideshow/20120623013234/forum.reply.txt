Text: This is probably the biggest monologue...
So here's a new problem. 

I have each project page and then I have a ajax template to load that content into other page, leaving the actual page as a fallback for noscript. Everything works fine except the sliders. I have exactly the same code except for the name of the variable I use. On the actual projects page I use $page and on the ajax I use $projects which is declared before as being $page->find("projects/").get("id").

I don't understand why it doesn't get the information from the project.txt

Thanks for any help.
