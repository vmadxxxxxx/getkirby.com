Text: Hey guys. It's me again...

I asked this question to Bastian by email which he kindly replied really fast as always.
 
The reasons I am posting here are: 1st because I wasn't able to make it work. 2nd because the answer will stay here for anyone in the future who might be wondering the same.

So, I want to have within my flow of content some slideshows. Bastian sent me these instructions 

```
Hey Sandro,

check out this Gist: https://gist.github.com/1711983 It's for inline galleries, but it should work as well for your slideshow. 
Just place that in site/plugins and call it kirbytext.extended.php

You should also add a new gallery.php snippet in site/snippets. Create your slideshow code there. Something like: 

<ul>
  <?php foreach($images as $image): ?>
  <li><img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" /></li>
  <?php endforeach ?>
</ul>

Afterwards all you need to do is to add the Gallery/Slideshow to your text like this: 

(gallery: 01.jpg, 02.jpg, 03.jpg)

If you prefer you can also rename the tag definition. It should be pretty straight forward.

```



unfortunately, after following these instructions it didn't work and I don't really have the knowledge to understand what's happening.

note: I have that problem with the rewrite on the config file so my urls all go like "/index.php/projects" I don't know if it has anything to do with it ...

Thanks in advanced
