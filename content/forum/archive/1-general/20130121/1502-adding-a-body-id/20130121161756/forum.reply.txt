Text: Sorry I thought it was clear. I want it to reflect the navigation,

the <php echo $page->template() ?> is great if all my pages had a template other than default, So i guess basing it on the page title or the the structure of the content folder is best. 



so the blog for instance including the posts

    <body id="blog">

and the portfolio page would be

    <body id="portfolio">



Thanks
