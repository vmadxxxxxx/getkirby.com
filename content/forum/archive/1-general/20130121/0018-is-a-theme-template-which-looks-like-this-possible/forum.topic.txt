Text: Hey,

I'm really new to this stuff, but today I felt the urge to create something on my own and bought Kirby right off the bat (maybe a bit rashly, but.. oh well).

So, my question is whether a design like on http://sirupsen.com/ or http://botalpha.com is possible with Kirby. Basically a layout in which only the part with the blog articles scrollable, while the "about"-whatever part isn't. Or would this be a problem due to the folder structure of Kirby?

If it is possible I'd greatly appreciate some links, which may help me learn the basics to achieve something like this.

Thanks!

/Edit: I just found http://buschfeuerdesign.de/ and http://kulorama.com/ which are both listed as made with Kirby, so I guess it is possible. A heads up on how-to do this would still be appreciated!
