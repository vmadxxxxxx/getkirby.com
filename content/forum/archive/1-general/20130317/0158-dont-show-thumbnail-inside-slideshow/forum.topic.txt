Text: Hi,
I have an little problem with images for an slideshow.
In the article folder I have on image with the name thumb.jpg and also some images for the slideshow. My problem now is that I don´t want to show the thumb image inside the slideshow.
Is there a way to set an subfolder for images or take one image out the array?

This ist the code for the slideshow

	<ul id="slider" class="rslides">
	<?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
	<li><img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="src="<?php echo $image->title() ?>"" /></li>
	<?php endforeach ?>
	</ul>
