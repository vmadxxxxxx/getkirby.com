Text: It will be super great for us and especially for our clients to put any king of image format *(.jpg, .png, .gif)* to generate thumbs and auto generate img *height* and *width* respecting WC3 standards.

So, there is two codes that I want unify:

This code is limited by file extension but it works for Thumb Plugin:
```php
<img src="<?php echo thumb($article->images()->find('thumb.jpg'), array('width' => 300, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true), false) ?>">
```

This code search img file by any extension but it doesn't work for Thumb Plugin:
```php
<?php $image = $article->images()->filterBy('name', 'thumb') ?>
<?php if($image): ?>
  <img src="<?php echo $image->first()->url() ?>"/>
<?php endif ?>
```
