Text: Hi,
actually I have for a tessite the standard Kirbytemplate with its content.
Now I want to load a JS-Script only on a specified template, for this I wrote a if query

	<?php
	if ($page->projects()) {
	echo js('assets/js/jquery.jpages.min.js');
	}
	?>
I have created a templatefile with the filename projects.php but it doesn't work.
How get it work?
