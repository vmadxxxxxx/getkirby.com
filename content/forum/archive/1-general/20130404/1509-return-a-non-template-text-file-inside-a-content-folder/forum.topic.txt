Text: This has me stumped.

I need to allows access to a text file that sits inside a Kirby content folder. If I try and access it like this: http://myserver.com/ping/pong.json it just goes to the default page as there's no template for pong.json

I tried making a pong.json.php template but still no joy.

The file has to be called pong.json as it's being called by an API.

Any ideas?

Cheers.
