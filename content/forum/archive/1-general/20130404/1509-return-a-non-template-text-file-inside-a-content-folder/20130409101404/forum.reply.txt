Text: Hey Brendan, 

you can ask for the current extension in your template with:

```php
if($site->uri()->extension) {
  // echo some json here
} else {
  // your default html stuff
}
```

This will be different in Kirby 2. I actually plan something in the line of pong.json.php as this will make it a lot more flexible. 

I hope this helps.
