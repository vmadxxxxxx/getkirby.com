Text: OK, I think I figured it out! I just took a look at [this question](http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:33) and after judiciously sticking `->flip()` in a couple of key phrases I have a reversed system working to my satisfaction. I'll probably stick with this— unless there's a better/more efficient method I'm missing?

Thanks!
