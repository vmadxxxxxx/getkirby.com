Text: Hi, I'm trying to create an album cover check box for a gallery/project slideshow on a home page. I've found a way to allow check boxes in file fields, but I seem to be having issues getting the album cover to take on the correct image if the box is checked.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've spent time on and off over the last week or so trying to figure this one out.

I feel like I've tried a hundred different things and nothing appears to work. This is my latest failed attempt at what I feel is probably an over complicated method.. it results in the last image always being used.

<pre><code>
		<?php
			foreach($pages->findByUID('portfolio')->visible()->children() as $item):
				if($item->hasImages()):
				
				
				do{
					foreach($item->images() as $image):
						if($image->albumcover() == "on"):
							$image = $item->$image;
							$albumCover = true;
						endif;
					endforeach;
					
					if(!(isset($albumCover))):
						$image = $item->images()->first();
						$albumCover = true;
					endif;
				} while(!(isset($albumCover)));
		?>
			<a class="thumb" href="<?php echo $item->url() ?>">
				<?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => '500', 'height' => '350', 'crop' => true, 'scale' => true)); ?>
				<span><?php echo $image->caption() ?></span>
			</a>
		<?php
				endif;
			endforeach;
		?>
</code></pre>


Here was an earlier attempt.. it results in the first image being used and never seems to set it to the albumcover image.

<pre><code>
		<?php
			foreach($pages->findByUID('portfolio')->visible()->children() as $item):
				if($item->hasImages()):
				
					if($item->images()->albumcover() == "on"):
						$image = $item->images()->albumcover() == "on";
					else:
						$image = $item->images()->first();
					endif
		?>
			<a class="thumb" href="<?php echo $item->url() ?>">
				<?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 400, 'height' => 300, 'crop' => true)); ?>
				<span><?php echo $image->caption() ?></span>
			</a>
		<?php
				endif;
			endforeach;
		?>

</code></pre>
