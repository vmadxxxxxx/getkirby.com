Text: I read the documentation on how to Add captions to images and it suggests creating a new txt file with the information on it and then referencing it:

	<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg') ?>
	<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $image->title() ?>" /> 
	<p><?php echo $image->caption() ?></p>

That would just display an image with a caption. How would I do that for a blog where I have the image as part of the post using **image: 02.png**

And referenced in my post.php as:

	<?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>

This displays everything in my post.txt including the image, if the image meta information is in a separate txt file how would I display the caption?
