Text: It probably is very simple but I can't find a way to create a tagcloud for just the tags for the current page. When displaying a post I would like to show the tags for the post and have these link to the page for that tag.

A tagcloud for all the posts works fine but I can't get it to filter down to just one post.

Thanks!
