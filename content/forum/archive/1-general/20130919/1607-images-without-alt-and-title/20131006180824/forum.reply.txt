Text: I had the same problem, although I prefer keeping the alt attribute while getting rid of the title. I tried copying the image function (lines 222 - 279 in my copy of kirbytext.php) from kirbytext.php to kirbytext.extended.php and deleted the title (and alt) attributes from $imageAttributes. Seems to work fine and doesn't touch the core files.
