Text: I agree with @fitzage, where would be the gain to use

    <?php echo image('assets/images/file.png') ?> */does not exist!*/

instead of

    <img src="<?php echo url('assets/images/file.png')?>" />

or even the absolute path?

You could of course hack the helper.php and add the function image similar to the css and js functions, at least until the next update is due.
