Text: Hi and thanks for the reply.

This works fine. But it must be _$page**s**_ not _$page_:

```php
<?php $image = $pages->find('home')->images()->filterBy('title', '*=', 'header-')->shuffle()->first(); ?>
```

I will use your workaround.

But I'm curious. So is it not possible to loop(?) through a folder in the assets folder?
