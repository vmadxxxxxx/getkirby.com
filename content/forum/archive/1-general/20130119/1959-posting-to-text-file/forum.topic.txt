Text: Maybe a simple problem for some people but i need to find out how i can post to a field within a text file.

For example if i had a text field on my page where i want to type my name and another where i wanted to type a comment, could this then be posted to a text file under certain headings?

     Title: Page title
     ----
     Text: Blah Blah Blah
     ----
     Name: "Name Here"
     ----
     Comment: "Comment here"
     ----

I managed to get the Like counter working but was unable to strip down the code and get this idea to work from that.

I really want to try and integrate a custom comments field and i would much prefer to do it this way over using Disqus or other 3rd party options.

Cheers people!
