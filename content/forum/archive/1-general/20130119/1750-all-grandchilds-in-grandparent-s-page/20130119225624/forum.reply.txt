Text: Without testing, something like this should work:

	$posts = $pages->find('news')
		->children()
		->children()
		->visible()	
		->sortBy($sort=’date’, $dir=’desc’);

This will of course require a date-field in all your articles, used to show the most recent first no matter if it's a news article, event article or what it is.
