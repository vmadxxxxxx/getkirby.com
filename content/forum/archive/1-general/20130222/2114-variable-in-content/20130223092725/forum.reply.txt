Text: Although this is not quite the same you could do it like this.

You could just use a [site variable in your config](http://getkirby.com/docs/advanced-stuff/custom-config-files)?

Or indeed a [snippet](http://getkirby.com/docs/snippets)?

Last but not least if you are determined to have it in a page, create separate text sections in the template for that page and then use snippets to include those elements in other pages?
