Text: Thanks! I hadn't noticed the debugging tool. I found the problem – had an extra ')' on one of the PHP tags. Fixed now.

Now that debugging is on, I noticed I'm getting this:

    Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /Users/daniel/Dropbox/www/linguistic_analysis/kirby/lib/variables.php on line 29

I haven't modified this file at all. Is this a known inssue?

Thanks!
