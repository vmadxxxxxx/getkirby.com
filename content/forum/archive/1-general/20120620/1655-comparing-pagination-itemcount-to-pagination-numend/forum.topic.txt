Text: I was working a bit on adding to the pagination snippet, so that in the case of, say, 6 results, it wouldn't say "6 Results / Showing 1-10", instead it would say "6 Results / Showing 1-6".

I thought this might be accomplished by having an if statement checking whether pagination->itemCount is greater than pagination->numEnd, if it is show itemCount, if it isn't, show numEnd.

I'm still a beginner with Kirby and with PHP, so I'm always wary of my syntax. So far, I can't get the code to work as expected. Anyone care to have a look here?

I suspect the statement in question is:
    <?php if($pagination->countItems() > $pagination->numEnd()) ?><?php echo $pagination->countItems() ?><?php else: ?><?php echo $pagination->numEnd() ?><?php endif ?>

Thanks in advance for your attention!
