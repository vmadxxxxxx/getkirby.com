AHHHHH thank you so much! I just removed the following line because I don't think I need it in my case

    $articles = $articles->sortBy('date','time');

and it seems to be doing just what I need! 

I can't thank you enough for your help. I wish I could bake you some cookies or something…

Now I just have to figure out how this works exactly :)
