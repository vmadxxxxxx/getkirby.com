Text: Dear Kirby users,
have any of you tried to use Kirby 1.1 for magazine website? I'm talking about thousands of publications per year with photos, videos and many king of topics.

1. In your opinion what are the biggest limitations that we can encounter?

2. What are the benefits that Kirby can give us?


*(Lets try to exclude the Panel so we can focus more on Kirby side)*
