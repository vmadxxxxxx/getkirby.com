Text: Hi, 
I just discovered Kirby and love it so far.

I am trying to play a wav or mp3 soundfile on a project page.
It should load when opening the project page.
the file is within the project folder.

What do i need to add to my project.php file, and what goes into the project.txt file?

In addition would it be possible to have a text link to that file?
Clicking the word "sound" would play the file again.

Thanks so much!
