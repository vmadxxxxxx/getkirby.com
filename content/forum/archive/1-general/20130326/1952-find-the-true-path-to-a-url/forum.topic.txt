Text: How would I go about finding the full file system path that Kirby CMS translates into a URL?

For example, on the site I'm working on now, Kirby uses this URL:

http://www.kirby.dev/portfolio/people/thumbnails/ 

to represent this file system path:

/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/SyncedSites/vhosts/www.kirby.dev/content/portfolio/people/thumbnails/

I'd like to feed a utility function the URL and get back the true file system path.

In the end, I want to create files and directories in PHP, so I need the file system path to create them in.
