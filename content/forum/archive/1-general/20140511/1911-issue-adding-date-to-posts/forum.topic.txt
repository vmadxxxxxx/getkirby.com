Text: I have read the directions on the tutorials page on how to add a date to a article, but for some reason it is not working for me. Not sure how to paste code on here so I put it on a hastebin.

If I use the SomeDate string it will put a date from 1970 on the page, but if I use date it shows nothing at all... not sure what the issue is here. I can't even get it to display any sort of error.
