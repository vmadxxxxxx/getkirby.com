Text: Hi!

You can do that with `sortBy`:

    <?php
    
      $sorted = $page->children->sortBy('rating', 'desc');
    
      foreach($sorted as $item):
    
    ?>

I’m not sure if you’re sorting blog posts, project or whatever else it could be, so be sure to exchange the `$page` variable with what content you need to pull.
