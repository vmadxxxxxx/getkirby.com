Text: Hi guys, 

Hope you are well and could spend couple minutes on my dilemma.

What I want to do is create separate page what will display only posts that have specific field in it, for example "Rating:".

That field value would be only numbers from 0 to infinity. So I need to sort those posts by that field value from highest to lowest.

Any ideas or help with that?

Thank you!
