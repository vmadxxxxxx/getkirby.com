Text: Well, let me try to explain.

Lets say I will have lists of recent articles on my home pages and for now there is two pages, 4 items in each.

On page 1 I need:

< article id="lastest-article">...< /article>
< article>...< /article>
< article>...< /article>
< article>...< /article>

On page 2 (and others if they will be there) I need:

< article>...< /article>
< article>...< /article>
< article>...< /article>
< article>...< /article>

Something like that.

Thanks!

P.S. Can't figure out how to put the code, so put spaces instead.
