Text: Okay, I have solved the problem - the link is working fine, when writing it like this:

MD: index.php#anchor
HTML: http://domain.com/index.php#anchor

To get it scrolled via the default jQuery-Scroll-Solution, it would be great to have relative links with the domain. Is this possible? No matter what I do in Markdown, I always get the absolute path to the link...

I now have built a workaround in the javascript, so that the scrolling is working fine...
