Text: This might not be specific to kirby but maybe someone can help me: for the lack of better alternatives I decided to upload every image in my content in the highest resolution possible to be prepared for the upcoming retina / HiDPI era. 

I threw (link: http://adaptive-images.com/ text: adaptive-images.php) on it to spare mobile devices but people on desktop will still get the full 4000px wide photograph from my DSLR which is ridiculous. 

Is there a way I can hook into kirbys content processing and size down any image to a reasonable size before it gets rendered as an HTML image link?

Or are there even any other ideas on how to handle images for high resolution devices with kirby?
