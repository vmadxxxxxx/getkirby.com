Text: Hello guys. I am fairly new to developing php, especially with kirby.

I've been trying to figure out how can I be able to have a projects that loops through all the existing projects and accesses to one of the thumbnails in order to display it as a link. 
My problem is I am using the submenu code to get all the projects and I have the code for getting all the images or just a specific one, but I am not being able to combine. 

It would be awesome if someone could give me an example of how to do this. 

say something if you want me to post a sample of the code ( I doubt it will help)

Thanks in advanced
