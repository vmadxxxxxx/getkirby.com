Text: Hey all-

I'm trying something a little different again. I want to have a divider between every five thumbs of a twenty thumb grid. 

So the thumbs are laid out horizontal and after five there is a horizontal divider. Is it possible in the loop to say display 1-5 / 5-10 / 10-15 etc? I'd obviously have to include four loops instead–but it's my work around in this situation.

Cheers
