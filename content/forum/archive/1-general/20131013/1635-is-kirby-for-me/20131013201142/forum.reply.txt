Text: Hi Sonja,

Thank you, Reading your reply I think I will try it out with the demo that is available and see if it is for me. I appreciate your response. I really want to simplify things and have a nice, lightweight minimal site.

P.S. I love your website. http://www.texniq.de/en/
Is that created with Kirby as well?
