Text: I'm having a bit of an issue with a file field in a blueprint.  I have a single file field in a blueprint which appears to be working fine.  The problem is, when I log in to the panel and edit a file, when I enter text in that file field (leaving the filename as is), I get a new *name already exists* message, even though I've not edited the filename.  An example filename would be FirstLastC-001.  If I rename the file as well, I'm able to save the edits to the file, including the file field I created.

Alternatively, if I create the text file for the image instead of going through the panel, everything seems to work fine, but it would be much more convenient to go through the panel.

TIA
