Text: I was wondering if it were possible to embed an image within the content of one of my pages with a relative url. I've tried but it only seems to work with absolute url's. 

I'm wondering if I need to make an adjustment to my config or htaccess file.

Also, does Kirby not support png images? I can't seem to get any png images to display in templates or pages. 

Thanks
