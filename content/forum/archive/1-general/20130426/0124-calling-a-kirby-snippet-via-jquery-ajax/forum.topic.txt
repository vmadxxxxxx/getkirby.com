Text: I would like to call a Kirby snippet with a jQuery AJAX call so that I have access to all the good Kirby-context variables and methods.

Bastian has suggested a call to a template of the form:

```
$('#picks').load('/snippetServer/snippet:somesnippet');
```

And then using a "director" at the start of the template to load the snippet like this:

```
<?php 
if(param('snippet')) {
  snippet(param('snippet'));
  exit();
}
?>
```

That all makes sense to me. But I'm confused about the path to use from the jQuery AJAX to get to the template file. Should it be:

```
/site/templates/snippetServer.php/snippet:targetSnippet
```

or:

```
/site/templates/snippetServer/snippet:targetSnippet
```

But either way I'm generating an error with the jQuery AJAX call.

Any advice?
