Text: This isn't an issue, but something I am trying hard to understand so would appreciate some coaching in how the htaccess file actually works.

In the htaccess file there are these lines:

      # make site links work
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
      RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php [L]

They seem to do the magic that takes a url like 'foo.com/about/team' and magically hands it over the the index.php file with (I presume) the correct query string.

But for the life of me i can't see how this works (but it does!) The main rewrite rule looks like it replaces everything in the url with 'index.php' , so in that case what happens to the '/about/team' part of the url?
