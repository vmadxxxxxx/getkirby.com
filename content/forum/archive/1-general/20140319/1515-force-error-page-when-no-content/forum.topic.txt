Text: I try to force an error page if...

 - ...no content is set on a special content variable.
 - ...no txt-file is found in the folder.
 - ...default template is used.

I tried to echo $page->template() in a file in the plugin folder but it was not found. Probably the $page object is created later.

How do I solve this? As a plugin or in the template. When in a template it's already has gone too far I think!?
