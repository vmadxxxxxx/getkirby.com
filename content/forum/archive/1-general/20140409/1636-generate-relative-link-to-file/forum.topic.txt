Text: Hi folks,

I have the following structure

    /content/company/persons/JohnAppleseed

So John's website has a lot Links to PDFs in it.
Those PDFs should be hosted in his folder.
So I create a folder named:

    /content/company/persons/JohnAppleseed/Pdfs

In the

    /content/company/persons/JohnAppleseed/site.txt

I'd like to have something like

    file:Pdfs/art1.pdf text:PDF

Seems not to be possible. 

Alternatively:

    file:company/persons/JohnAppleseed/Pdfs/art1.pdf text:PDF

doesn't work too.

Any suggestions?

Having all the files in John's folder is no option - those are like 100 files...

Thanks!
