Text: As far as I can tell from the current source at [GitHub](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby) and from my usage experience with development versions of Kirby 2, nothing will actually change. You will still be able to use your current snippets, templates and plugins.
There will be a change with the index.php and probably with the .htaccess, but that's it.

The fact that Kirby 2 development is intransparent is not true, the last commit on the v2 repo is 10 days ago.
There's also no "v2" branch, instead there's a whole new GitHub organization (`getkirby`)

And a final point: If you wouldn't know Kirby 2 will come, would you criticize anything? Kirby 1 works perfectly, and Kirby 2 will be a simple upgrade, why don't we just wait until it is out?
