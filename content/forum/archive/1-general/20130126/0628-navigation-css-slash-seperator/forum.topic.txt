Text: I'm trying to switch from Wordpress to Kirby. I'm currently testing it out on my seperate domain Rhinofeed.net, but I want to mimict the navigation found on my main website, Rhinofeed.com.

Here's a screenshot:

I would like slash separators in between each page, but not before and not after the first and last pages. Thanks for your help.
