Text: I am trying to find a way to access the $site (and $page) variable within a plugin, without having to pass it as an argument to the function. 

I have been experimenting and the only way that I could really find is by passing the variable in the function. 

Does anyone have any other ways to get around this, as if the plugin is to be released to the public (which I hope it will be in the future), I don't really want them to have to pass in a variable every time.

(I have just put the plugin on GitHub, it can be found (link: https://github.com/RobBrazier/kirby-getimage text: here) if you want to see the context)
