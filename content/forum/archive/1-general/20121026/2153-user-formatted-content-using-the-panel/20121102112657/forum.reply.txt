Text: I already started an article about WYSIWYG editors and Kirby before I read this thread and I think I will keep that unpublished for a little longer. It's a difficult question. For me WYSIWYG editors have always been a nightmare. You absolutely loose control as a designer and developer as soon as you let your clients do all sorts of crazy things with those pseudo Word-like editors. There are a few out there, which offer quite nice ways to control formats, but in general they are still a mess and they always bring huge amounts of extra code with them. 

For my own clients I always managed to teach them how to use the most simple Markdown tags. My experience is that clients mostly need like 4 or 5 different formats max. Stuff like bold text, images, links and maybe how to define a list and different kinds of headlines. When I explained the benefits of using simple tags instead of letting them do their own formatting, they never had an issue with getting used to those. 

I think the most important part is to make sure to let the CMS do most of the "structure work". I always try to break down pages into many small sections if possible, so clients never really need to layout/format huge amounts of text. I also got the experience that most clients find updating their site way easier, the more guidance they have and the more they just need to enter plain text.

For the panel though there are really some important missing buttons like you guys already mentioned and I'm working hard to add them asap. I think it also needs some kind of comfortable preview mode like @roman_oroco suggested. All this is on my todo list and I hope I can make it more comfortable for your clients to edit text soon.
