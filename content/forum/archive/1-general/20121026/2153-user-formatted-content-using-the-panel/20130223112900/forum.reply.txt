Text: Hi,
a really easy to integrate solution is (link: http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/home/ text:markitup-editor). It works directly with jQuery and it have setups also for markdown syntax.
And it is really easy to add some new buttons with own syntax.

I think this is a really good solution to have an Editor at the panel and not the trouble with an WYSIWYG-Editor.
