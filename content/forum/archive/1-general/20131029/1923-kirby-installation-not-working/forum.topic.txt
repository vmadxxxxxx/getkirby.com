Text: Hello guys,

I recently got into HTML and CSS and I am now trying to get Kirby to work.

I bought some serverspace on campusspeicher.de and I am now failing miserably to get Kirby to work.

Opening the domain: robinscholz.de just results in an automatic download of the index.php file.

I uploaded Kirby to the httpdocs subfolder and I also tried uploading it to the parent folder which results in an access denied message.

Could anybody tell me what the mistake is? Its kind of discouraging being stuck this early on in the process …

Thanks!
