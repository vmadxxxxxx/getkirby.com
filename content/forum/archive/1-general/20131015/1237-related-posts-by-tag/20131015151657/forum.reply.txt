Text: You could probably use the Tagcloud and modify the output, but all you need is a `filterBy` on pages?

"`$pages->filterBy($key, $value, $split=false)`
*filters a set of pages by a key and a value.
if you pass a splitting character as third arg. it will try to split a single value. ie. a comma sperated list of tags and search within its elements. returns the filtered set of pages.*"

Something like (not tested)

```php
$filtered = $pages->find('yourarticles')
->children()
->filterBy('$key','$value');
```
And then loop through the results and output the text and links?

I did some form filtering for someone else ages ago using TagCloud, but it should give you the idea...

and the related

Hope it helps
