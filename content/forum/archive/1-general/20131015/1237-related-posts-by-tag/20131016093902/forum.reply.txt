Text: @fitzage: yes, it will work if only one tag is specified at the tag field. However, I give only one tag to each article, so it works. :) 

But yes, it requires `explode()` if you have more than one tag assigned.

Also, it can be combined with `shuffle()` instead of `flip()` after the `not($page->uid())`, so you can pull random related posts.
