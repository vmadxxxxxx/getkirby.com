Text: Thanks Russ, in the meanwhile I was also experimenting with `filterBy()`.

First I tried to pass the variable to the filter by `$tag = $page->tag()` but that wasn't working. Later on I found out that the problem was that this requires a string to work, so with `strval()` it works really nice. :)

So the whole thing is like

`$tag = strval($page->tag());
$articles = $pages->find('blog')->children->visible()->filterBy('tag', $tag)->flip()->paginate(5);
foreach ($articles as $article)`

The only thing I have to do is to strip the current article from the list and it should be OK.

Edit: done with `->not($page->uid())` after the `filterby()`.

Thanks anyway,
Adam
