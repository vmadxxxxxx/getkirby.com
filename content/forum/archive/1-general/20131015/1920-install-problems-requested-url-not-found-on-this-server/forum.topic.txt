Text: Hi, I'm running a trail of kirby.  I followed the install instructions and get this error when clicking 'about' on the kirby test page:

'The requested URL /kirby/about-us was not found on this server.

I've done everything in the getting started page down to and including adding:

RewriteBase /kirby  to .htaccess

I have checked that rewrite rules are available and on by default with my hosting service. 

I added all the files and folders of the install to a folder named kirby at httpdocs root level.

MY url is:

http://studioshitless.com/kirby

Can anyone advise, please?
