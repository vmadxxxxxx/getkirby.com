Text: I think those "Next page", "Previous Page" navigators at the bottom of each site are year 2000. I would like to disable this and somehow "activate" endless scrolling. So that the most recent x posts are shown and while scrolling down KirbyCMS will load another y posts.

Any hints or even solutions?
Thanks in advance.
