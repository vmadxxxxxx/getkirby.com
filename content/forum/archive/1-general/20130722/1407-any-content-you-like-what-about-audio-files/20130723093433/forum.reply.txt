Text: Hi !  Thank you for the answer.
With Jplayer I would need something like http://www.jplayer.org/latest/demo-02/

Or dewplayer but I would not be able to change colors.

Can you give me an example of what you did with JPlayer ? (and how you call it etc).

Thank you !!

PS: would be great to have a section like http://getkirby.com/blog/html5-videos but for audio :)
