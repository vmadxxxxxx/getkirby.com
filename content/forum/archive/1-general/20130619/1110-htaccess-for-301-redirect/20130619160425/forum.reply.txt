Text: @russ,

Thanks for your link. It helped me to figure out the right syntax!

I used the apache directives used in Kirby original.htaccess file as part of my virtualHost settings as it allows some performance gain AND save me from having to set multiple .htaccess

The code I used to redirect my old static site to kirby enabled site is as follow:

    Redirect /folderName/ArticleName   /newFolderNameBasedOnKirbySetup/ArticleName

Hope this helps anyone who may encounter the same problem as me
