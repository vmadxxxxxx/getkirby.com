Text: I'm wondering how I would go about pulling the title and content from one page and displaying it on another non-related page.  I have a news page, which is displaying summaries and links to news articles (blog style), which are descendants of the news page.  What I'd like to do is also display a news feed - say the three most recent articles - on the home-page.  Any ideas?

P.S. - I was not able to find a suitable answer by searching the forum.

Thanks,

Chris
