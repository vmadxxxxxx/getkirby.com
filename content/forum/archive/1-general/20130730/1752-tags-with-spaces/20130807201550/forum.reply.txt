Text: To turn my tags "url-friendly", I created the following file in my plugins folder:
(link: https://gist.github.com/diogochaves/6176801)

To use it, simple call the method using the 'tag->name()' as a parameter:
`<?php echo tagslug($tag->name()) ?>`

It converts "Anual Repôrtsçãë" to "anual-reportscae" (regexp is really something).

Hope it helps to solve your problem.
