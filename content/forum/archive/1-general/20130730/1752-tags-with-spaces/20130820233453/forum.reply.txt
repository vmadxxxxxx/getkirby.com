Text: Just an update to my previous posts. I ended up going with a somewhat simple solution that works fine for my case. I edited the tagcloud.php plugin file (<a href="https://gist.github.com/craiglock/58484d0afbffc9eeef88">Gist with snippet of edited code</a>). I change the line <code>'name' => $t</code> to <code>'name' => urldecode($t)</code>. In the Panel, the user just needs to use a <code>+</code> instead of a space in tags with spaces. So the url ends up being <code>/tag:User+Interface</code> and the front-end displays it as "User Interface" which works fine for this case. 

Hope this helps anyone that has a similar issue. There are probably more elegant solutions, like described above, but in my case, this was the one I was able to do with my skillset, and it works simple enough. 

Thanks again for the help, @fitzage!
