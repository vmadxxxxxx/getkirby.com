Text: I'm trying to add a 301 redirect to the .htaccess file as we have a few domains all for the same site and I want to consolidate them into the one. 

When adding in the usual 301 redirect it just redirects everything onto the homepage and nothing else. All inner links no longer work and just redirect to index.php. 

Any ideas on where I could be going wrong?

Thanks in advance.
