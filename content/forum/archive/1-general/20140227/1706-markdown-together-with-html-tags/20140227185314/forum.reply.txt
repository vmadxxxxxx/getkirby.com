Text: 1. It looks to me like you're putting your markdown in the template instead of in the content file. But maybe that's just how you did your code block for this post.
2. You can't generally use markdown inside an html div. However, if you enable markdown extra in your config file, you can use this method:

```html
<div markdown="1">

### Headline

Some Text

</div>
```
