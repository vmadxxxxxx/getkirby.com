Text: How would I create and display two (or more) separate menus? For example...

    Main menu
        Home
        Website Design
        Web Hosting
        SEO
        Contact Us

    Footer menu
        Support
        Jobs
        Legal
        About Us

It would be handy to have a way to do this in Kirby, maybe by grouping pages into distinct menu folders:

    /
        content
            _menu1
                01-website-design
                02-web-hosting
                etc...
            _menu2
                01-support
                02-jobs
                etc....

Any thoughts? Or is this already possible?
