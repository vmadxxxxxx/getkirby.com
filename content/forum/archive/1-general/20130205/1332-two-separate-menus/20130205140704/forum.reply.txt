Text: Would be a nice addition. Maybe you could add an extra line to your parent text-files (Home, Website Design, Support, ...) where you define your menu:

	title: Foo
	----
	menu: header

In your header-menu, you can now check if `$page->menu()` is *header*. I'm not quite sure about performance – but as the whole content file is loaded anyway, it might not be a problem.
