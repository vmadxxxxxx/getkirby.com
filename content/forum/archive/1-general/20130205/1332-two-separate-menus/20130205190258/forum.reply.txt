Text: I use your solution in another project of mine. The problem with this solution is that you can't add or delete main pages without editing your templates/snippets. Sometimes (like in the project I used it) it's okay or even neccessary to do so, but sometimes – and your content tree looked like that – it is better to stay flexible.
