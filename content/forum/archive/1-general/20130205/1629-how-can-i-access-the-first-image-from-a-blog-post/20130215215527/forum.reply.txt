Text: Had the same problem recently until we came up with a solution:

The code was correct, the error simply fired because there was no image in on of the sites, which of course led to the 'non-object' error when trying to output the url with '->url()'.

So my advice is to check if there are any images in your php code and only execute when there is one.
