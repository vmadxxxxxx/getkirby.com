Text: Hi Forum,

I'm working on my first Kirby powered site and I've run into a problem I find difficult to solve.

I have a foreach loop in my blog page:

    foreach($page->children()->visible() as $product):

Then, I try to call the first image with this code:

    <img src="<? echo $product->images()->first()->url() ?>" />

But I get a ***Fatal error*** Call to a member function url() on a non-object in my product template.

Does anybody have any idea what might be going on here?

Thanks!

Irma
