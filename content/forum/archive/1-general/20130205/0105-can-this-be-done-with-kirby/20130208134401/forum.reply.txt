Text: Thanks so much Bastian. I assume you would just use the Auth::firewall for protected pages and then use the above code for the lessons? Sounds great.

However, I've run into a problem with the above. In my template it returns this warning twice:

    Warning: trim() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in /Users/me/Sites/myurl.com/kirby/parsers/yaml.php on line 7


It's probably for the yaml() function? If I try to print_r($courses) or print_r($lessons) they're also empty:

    Array()
