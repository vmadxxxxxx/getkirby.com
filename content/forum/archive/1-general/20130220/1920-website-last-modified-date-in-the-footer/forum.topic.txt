Text: Hi,

I'm currently experimenting with Kirby on localhost -- so far so nice, I managed to achieved everything I wanted.

Everything, except one: I'd like to display the date the site was last modified in the footer (most likely in the footer.php snippet). So basically what I need is the data from the "date" of the latest blogpost. 

Is it even possible to get that?

Thanks,
Adam
