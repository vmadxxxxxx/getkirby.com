Text: This should be possible. I guess the problem here is the following line:

```php
<?php $color = ($site->color() != 'white') ?>
```

After this line `$color` is always `true` (which is obviously not a color but a boolean value). I'd suggest you to delete that line and use the following code instead:

```php
<style>
  body {
    background-color: <?php echo $site->color() ?>;
  }
</style>
```

PS: I don't know anything about your content administrator but if it is anyone but you, I'd do a `<select>` instead of a plain ol' textfield as it ensures that there's a valid color value provided.
