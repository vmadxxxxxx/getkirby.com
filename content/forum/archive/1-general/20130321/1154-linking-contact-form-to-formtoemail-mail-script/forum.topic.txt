Text: Hi guys.
I have the classic 'Form To Email' php script and I have placed it within my templates folder. I wanted to link the simple contact form on my contact page (contact.php) to it so I added this:
`<form action="<?php echo url('FormToEmail') ?>" method="post">`

The thing is that I am getting an error saying the link is broken. How do I correctly link the FormToEmail.php? Thank you
