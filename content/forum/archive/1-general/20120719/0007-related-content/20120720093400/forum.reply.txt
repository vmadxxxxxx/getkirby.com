Text: @fitzage you are thinking way too complicated :) 

Just add two fields to your content file: 

```
Title: Some title
----
Text: Some text
----
Partners: 
- partners/a-related-partner
- partners/b-related-partner
----
Customers: 
- customers/a-related-customer
- customers/b-related-customers

```

and in your template: 

```

<?php foreach(related($page->partners() as $partner): ?>
<!-- list the related partners -->
<?php endforeach ?>

<?php foreach(related($page->customers() as $customer): ?>
<!-- list the related customers -->
<?php endforeach ?>

```
