Text: This should work pretty well, although what I really want to do is have two separate types of related content on the same page, because I want to display customers as one thing and partners as another.

However, I imagine I can do this just by filtering when I display them on the page. So I would have one related field, and then only display the customers with one tag and display the partners with another tag.

So something like this would work, right?
