Text: If I understand what you want, I think it's possible. 
With the Panel, you can do it like following :

* Create a blueprint for your product page and add at the end :
<pre>
filefields:
  caption:
    label: Caption
    type: text
  isproductimage:
    label: Product image (write 'yes' to make this image appears on the product section of the page)
    type: text
  iscomponentimage:
    label: Component image (write 'yes' to make this image appears on the component section of the page)
    type: text
</pre>
* In your template file like [this](http://pastebin.com/WkcLPAaj)
<br />
If you're not using the panel, keep the code from template.php.
For each images you want to display on your page, put them in the same folder as your page file. 
Then create a samenameasfile.fileextension.fileExtensionForYourPageFiles (mine is .txt, you have the choice in /site/config/config.php)
e.g : If your file is named photo_product_1.png, you have to create a file named photo_product_1.png.txt, and put [those lines](http://pastebin.com/QcetUDqe) inside.

Now each time you add an image, set yes at Isproductimage/Iscomponentimage in yourimage.extension.txt and it will appears automatically on your product page :)
