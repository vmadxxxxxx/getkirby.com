Text: This is a slightly different way to achieve the same result.

1. Create a hidden/visible content folder called featured and add the content to it.

2. create a snippet called featured.php

3. add the below code to snippet

        <?php $featured = $pages->findByUID('featured') ?>
        <h2><?php echo $featured->title() ?></h2>
        <img src="<?php echo $featured->images()->first()->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($featured->title()) ?>" /></a>
        <?php echo $featured->text() ?>

4. put the snippet wherever you want to show the content.

        <?php snippet('featured')?>
