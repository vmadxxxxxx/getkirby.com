Text: I'm trying to develop a simple automatic slider with *title* and *excerpt* only for specific pages, example:

```
Title: This is page
Slider: On
Description: Excerpt text
```

1. Simply writing **Slider: On** will automatically go on slider. (With a specific image like *big-thumb.jpg* or whatever image cropped to specific size for slider)

2. I also thought some idea with a **radio button** with the status 'checked'

3. On WordPress it's possibile assign a specific category for displaying posts on slider, so it's possible on Kirby too?



I very appreciated any help.
