Text: Hi guys,

I am doing a little photo gallery for a friend and he asked if it were possible to have his friends upload images to him as well. Ideally, I'd like to integrate it into his Kirby photo site.

Any ideas on how to best implement this? I think there is no upload plugin for Kirby yet. Could I maybe repurpose the upload functions from the panel for this? Or any other PHP uploaders that you have tried and can recommend?
