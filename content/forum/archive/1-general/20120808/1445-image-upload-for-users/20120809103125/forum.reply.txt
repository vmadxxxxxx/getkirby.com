Text: You should be able to do the following. Copy panel/lib/upload.php to your site/plugins folder and use the upload plugin in your template like this: 

```

<?php

$upload = upload::file('file', '/path/to/the/upload/directory/{name}.{extension}');

if(get('submit')) {

  if(error($upload)) {
    echo msg($upload);
  } else {
    echo 'your file has been uploaded'
  }
  
}

?>

<!-- 

put your upload form here 
and make sure to set mulitpart enctype

-->

```

There are a view options available which you can set in your config:

```php

// allowed mime types for file uploads
c::set('upload.allowed', array(
  'image/jpeg', 
  'image/pjpeg',
  'image/png',
  'image/x-png', 
  'image/gif',
  'application/pdf',
  'application/gzip',
  'application/zip',
));

// this will be set by the php settings by default
c::set('upload.maxsize', upload::max_size());

// set this to false to return an error on overwriting files
c::set('upload.overwrite', true)

```

You can also change the default error messages like this: 

```php

l::set('upload.errors.missing-file', 'The file has not been found');
l::set('upload.errors.file-exists', 'The file exists and cannot be overwritten');
l::set('upload.errors.invalid-upload', 'The upload failed');
l::set('upload.errors.too-big', 'The file is too big');
l::set('upload.errors.invalid-file', 'The file type is not allowed');
l::set('upload.errors.move-error', 'The file could not be moved to the server');
l::set('upload.success', 'The file has been uploaded');

```
