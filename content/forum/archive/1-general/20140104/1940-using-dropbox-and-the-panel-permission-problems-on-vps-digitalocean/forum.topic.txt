Text: Hi,

kirby is using www-data to write files. I am as well as dropbox using the username janfi.

If I change ownership to janfi:janfi I can FTP my files over without issue and dropbox works well, but the Panel cannot write.

If I change ownership to www-data:www-data kirby panel can write, but I cannot use dropbox or FTP.

janfi:www-data (kirby panel cannot write, I can)
www-data:janfi (kirby panel can write, I cannot)

I would like to be able to FTP and use dropbox from my username, and have the Panel write as well. How do I do this?


Thanks a ton.
