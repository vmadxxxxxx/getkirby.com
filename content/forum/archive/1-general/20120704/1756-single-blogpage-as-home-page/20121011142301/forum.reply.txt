Text: I had success calling and displaying the latest blog post using the following method. I'm not sure if there are any problems with the way I managed it, so if anyone spots a problem, let me know. Thanks.

    <?php $latest = $pages->find('blog')->children()->last(); ?>
    <article>
      <h1><?php echo html($latest->title()) ?></h1>
      <?php echo kirbytext($latest->text()) ?>
    </article>`
