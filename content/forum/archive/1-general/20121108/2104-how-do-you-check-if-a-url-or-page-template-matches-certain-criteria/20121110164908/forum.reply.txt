Text: Probably not the purest way to do it, but ended up having a random full background image based on a theme by going like this:

in my footer snippet which gets loaded on almost every page i wrote:
(repeat this code and change url for as many dir with theme images you want to pull)

	<?php if ($page->url() == "path/to/page") { // when url is met…
	
		$project = $pages->find('path/to/dir/images'); // go fetch the page
		$bg_image  = $project->images()->shuffle()->first();  // gimme just one random
	}  
	?>	
	
	<img src="<?php echo $bg_image->url() ?>" id="bg_image" alt="">


which gets resized/scaled with JS:

	$(document).ready(function() {   
		
			var theWindow        = $(window),
			    $bg              = $("#bg_image"),
			    aspectRatio      = $bg.width() / $bg.height();
			    			    		
			function resizeBg() {
				
				if ( (theWindow.width() / theWindow.height()) < aspectRatio ) {
				    $bg
				    	.removeClass()
				    	.addClass('bgheight');
				} else {
				    $bg
				    	.removeClass()
				    	.addClass('bgwidth');
				}
							
			}
			                   			
			theWindow.resize(function() {
				resizeBg();
			}).trigger("resize");
		
		});


then styled with CSS:

	#bg_image { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: -99; }
	.bgwidth { width: 100%; }
	.bgheight { height: 100%; }

I guess you could do it with a template and snippet technique only without an if statement, but if you have the same main code shared across several pages this could be worth a try. 

I thought I'd share this anyway…
