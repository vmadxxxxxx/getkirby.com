Text: Lets say I have a set of snippets. But I only want them to be run on a specific event or when a URL or page or a template matches.
I found out that you can check if a loaded page's url matches and then execute a snippet:

	<?php if
	($page->url() == "http://http://test123.dev/a-page");
	echo snippet('nameofthesnippet');
	?>

Is there better or fancier way to check URLs or if a certain page or template is loaded?
