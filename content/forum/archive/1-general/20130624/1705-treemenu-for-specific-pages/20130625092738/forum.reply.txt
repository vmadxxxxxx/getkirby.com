Text: Thanks for the quick reply.

The solution outlined in the other thread seems to work fine for one tree menu. In my case I am trying to show two tree menus right next to each other.

One of them shows lists all visible pages and their children – this is the menu working fine right now.

	<?php if(!isset($subpages)) $subpages = $site->pages() ?>

The other menu is supposed to show only specific pages and their respective children – that is the one returning the error.

	<?php if(!isset($subpages)) $subpages = $site->$pages->find('boerse') ?>
