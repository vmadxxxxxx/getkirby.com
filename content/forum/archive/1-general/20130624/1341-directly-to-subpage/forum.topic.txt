It's my first few steps with Kirby- it's great stuff so far but I'm already stuck: I want to direct the homepage directly to a subpage. So if someone types in the domain he/she lands on a subpage.
Also if someone clicks on a link in the main navigation that the user comes directly to the first point of the submenu...

I hope this is easy...

Thanks in advance.
