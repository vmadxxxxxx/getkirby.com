Text: I use Codekit and have put most of my files in the assets folders with sub folders for files, fonts, images (site ones e.g icons), js and styles. 

Some files are linked from a central repository (a useful Codekit feature) but the rest of them are in these folders. I link to the Codekit compiled versions from my HTML template in Kirby. 
For example:

**Linking an icon:**

	<link rel="shortcut icon" href="<?php echo url('assets/images/favicon.ico') ?>" type="image/x-icon" />   
	<link rel="shortcut icon" href="<?php echo url('assets/images/favicon.png') ?>" type="image/png"/>

**Linking a combined stylesheet created form Less in Codekit:**

    <?php echo css('assets/styles/style.css') ?>

**Linking to combined Javascript files created in Codekit:**

     <?php echo js('assets/js/combined-scripts.min.js') ?>

I have not 'versioned' these yet, as I was planning on using the [HTML5 Boilerplate 'cache busting' technique](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/doc/htaccess.md) but just have not got around to it yet.
