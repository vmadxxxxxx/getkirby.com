Text: Is it possible to use a custom excerpt?

I’ve been trying to use something similar to that used in Scriptogram, where the excerpt is presented in the document YAML header:

    Title: Doc title
    ----
    Date: date
    ----
    Excerpt: Some text here
    ----
    Text: Some text

But I’m not sure if this is even possible.
