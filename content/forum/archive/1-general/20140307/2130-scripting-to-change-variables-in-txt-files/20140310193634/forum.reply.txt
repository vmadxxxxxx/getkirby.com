Text: I am not entirely sure what you are asking here. What you've written in terms of assigning the $path_to_file seems about right. What exactly is the problem?

Instead of using `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`, you could also use Kirby's global variables set in index.php, for example:

    global $rootSite;  // will usually be the same as $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
    $path_to_file = $rootSite.'/path/to/file/file.txt';

Look at index.php in the root directory of the site for other such global path variables.
