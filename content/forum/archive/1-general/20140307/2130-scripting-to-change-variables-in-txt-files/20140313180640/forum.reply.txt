The script is called after a form is submitted, and run by the server. It's not part of the templates or content, so Kirby doesn't do its thing - it's running independently. So, I'd like to activate kirby to be able to use its functionality.

But, I don't understand how the .htaccess URL rewriting happens, so I'm also wondering that targeting `/photos/photo-one/photo.txt` when the 'real' URL is actually `/content/01-photos/01-photo-one/photo.txt` would still work..
