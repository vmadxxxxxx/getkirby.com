Text: I'm having an issue with my live version of Kirby. It works fine on my local but when I upload to my liver server, the homepage loads fine but the other pages just get a 404 not found error?

I even tried to upload a fresh untouched copy of Kirby to my GoDaddy servers, in the root directory and still get same problem.

Any ideas?!!
