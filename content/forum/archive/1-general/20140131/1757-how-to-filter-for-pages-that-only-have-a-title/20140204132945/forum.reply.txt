Text: Indeed. That is why I thought I would put my question out there to see if someone had a really cool solution to this. I don't believe I am the only one who would like to filter a set of pages by searching for NOT existing keys, or for pages with keys that are just set i.e. `filterBy($key, <anyValue>)`.
Anyway, I solved my specific issue the following way:

    <?php
        if ($page->hasChildren()) { 
            # find visible folders/children
            $visibleChildren = $page->children()->visible();
            echo '<ul class="exhibitors">';

            # Filter for visible children
            foreach ($visibleChildren as $child) {

                # Filter for pages that have a title. Since kirby uses the uid as a title automatically for active directories (format: Nr-Name) 
                # even if they hold no content, check that the name is not equal to the uid (= folder name).
                # For pages that hold more than just the title, create a link to the child.
                # For visible children/folders with content that only holds a title, display just the unlinked title.
                # Since there is no negative filter function, check for two exemplary keys to see if more than just title is set.
                if (trim($child->title()) && (trim($child->title()) != $child->uid()) && ( !empty(trim($child->website())) or !empty(trim($child->text())) ) ) {
                    echo '<li><a href="' . $child->url() . '" >' . $child->title() . '</a></li>';
                }
                elseif ( !empty(trim($child->title())) && trim($child->title()) != $child->uid() ) {
                    echo '<li>' . $child->title() . '</li>';
                } 
            }
            echo '</ul>';
        } ?>
