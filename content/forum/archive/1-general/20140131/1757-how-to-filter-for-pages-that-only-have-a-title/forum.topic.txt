Text: Hi all,

does anyone know of a smart way of filtering for pages that only have the title key-value set?
In particular I am listing a set of child-pages on a (parent) page, and I would like to only state an unlinked title for pages that hold no further information. 
Is there such a thing as negative a files()->filterBy() function? 

Looking forwards to your nifty answers,
Cheers.
