Text: There are a couple of things that could be a problem with the first one. I think the issue is that it's returning an array instead of an individual item, so you just need to add `->first()`.

Like so:

```php
<?php $productpage = $pages->find($page->product())->first() ?>
```
Other potential issue is that `find()` doesn't always work well without a full path, so you could try `findByUID()` instead, which might still need the `->first()` at the end.
