Text: After half a day reading through most of the forum I managed to come up with a solution. Does not allow me to pass in a page .txt field contents into "$pages->find()", so I still wonder how that is possible, if it is so.

Anyhow, these two posts helped me sort it all out:

<http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:11>
<http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:746>

And what I did was (the folder containing the products is a sibling of my homepage and the product page is a child of the products page):

    <?php 

    $productpage = $page->siblings()->find('products')->children()->find($page->product->value);

    ?>
