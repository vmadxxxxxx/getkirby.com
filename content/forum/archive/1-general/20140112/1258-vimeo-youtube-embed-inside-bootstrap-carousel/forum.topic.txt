Text: Hi,

I'm trying to figure out a way to get vimeo and youtube embeds inside of the bootstrap carousel (and not just images). Is this possible/something anyone else has tried to do? 

Since I'm not displaying or using image captions in the theme.. my first thought was to try and pass the video URL as a caption of a static image that would then be replaced by video embed. This way you could sequence the video embed(s) with any images in the carousel.

I'm not the most adept with php but have a good understanding. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Thanks.
