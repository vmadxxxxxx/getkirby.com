Text: Hi everyone.

I followed Bastians instructions on this thread (link: http://getkirby.com/forum/general/topic:35.) And got everything working fine on one folder, but i can’t figure out how to get the id assigned to the contents of the subfolders. 

So in short this works:
     $project = $pages->find('projects/' . get('id'));

but i have subfolders in the project folder which should be loaded in with the ajax call. I get a list of the id’s with something like this:
     $project = $pages->find('projects')->children('' . get('id'));

But the id’s don’t seem to get assigned to the subfolder content links.

Hard coding the path like this:
     $project = $pages->find(‘projects/subfolder' . get('id'));
Will get me the right stuff for one subfolder but then i don’t know how to get the content of the others. And hardcoding the path would put me out of the possibility to add more subfolders without having to hardcode the paths.

Is there a solution for this in kirby? Or is it strictly a php issue?

Hope someone can spare a minute to put me in the right direction.

Thans in advance. Really enjoying kirby so far.
