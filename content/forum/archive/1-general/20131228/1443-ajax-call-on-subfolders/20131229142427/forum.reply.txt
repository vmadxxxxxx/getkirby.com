Text: Hi, thanks for the suggestion. Got to the right directories with:


	->children()->children()

But it somehow it didn't assign the id:s to the links . What did the trick was to add a ->find() before get id. Heres the line, if someones trying to achieve something similar.


	$project = $pages->find('projects')->children()->children()-
	>find(get('id'));


Maybe there is a more elegant solution for this, but seems to be working fine for me.
