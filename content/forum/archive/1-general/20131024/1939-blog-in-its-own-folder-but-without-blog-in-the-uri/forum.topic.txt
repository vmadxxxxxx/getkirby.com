Text: Hi there,

in config.php I could set another folder/directory as my homepage. E.g. with 

    c::set('home', 'home');

Unfortunately this add '/blog/' to all article URIs. Is there a way to have the article subfolders in their own folders but getting rid of the '/blog/'?

Many THX in advance.
