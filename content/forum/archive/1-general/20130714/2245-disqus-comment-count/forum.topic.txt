The comment count shows as 0 on my [home page](http://aqeelfikree.com), yet there is 1 comment on the [article](http://aqeelfikree.com/a-third-awesome-article#disqus_thread).

The only two things that I've changed is the shortname, and /blog/
I've changed the shortname with my shortname, and
/home/ instead of /blog/ (I'm not sure if I have to do that. I've used home as my home page, not blog)

Has anyone had any luck doing this?
