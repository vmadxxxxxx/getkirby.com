Text: Strange, I'm still getting a 0 even after changing it to home/

The way I've coded the site in order to hide the home from the url, what I've done is used:

    url(article->uid())

instead of

    article->url()

So that when you click on the title of the post instead of getting:

http://aqeelfikree.com/home/a-third-awesome-article

you'd get:

http://aqeelfikree.com/a-third-awesome-article

But I've also changed it back so that it shows home in the url to see if that helps show the comment number, but it didn't.

This is the code I'm using to show the clickable "Comment: 0" - maybe this'll help give an idea.

      <div class="comment">
        <a href="<?php echo url($article->uid()) ?>#disqus_thread">Comments: <?php snippet("disquscount", array("identifier" => $article->uri())); ?></a>
      </div>
