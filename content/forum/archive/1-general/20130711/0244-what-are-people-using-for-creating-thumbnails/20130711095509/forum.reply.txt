Text: I'm using the [Thumbnail plugin on a few sites](http://www.andreainsworth.com). Yes there can be problems with PHP and GD versions, what versions do you have?

If they need fixing and you cannot fix them try and get your ISP todo it. Otherwise manually creating them client side is an option or make/use some other code. Problem is the 'other' code will probably rely on GD or alternatives anyway.

Not sure why PNG for thumbs, try jpg if possible?
