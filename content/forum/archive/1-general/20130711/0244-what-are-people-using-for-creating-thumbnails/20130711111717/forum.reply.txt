Text: Thanks for the info.

The PHP versions:
Live: 5.4.8
Dev:5.4.10

I'm experiencing precisely the same problems on both environments.

As for switching PNGs for JPGs: I've tried that. The file size of the thumbs is slightly improved but the same issue is occurring.

I am not in a position to verify this, but some people have mention having issues with the thumb extension but no issues with, say, WordPress image resizing (which uses GD as well).
