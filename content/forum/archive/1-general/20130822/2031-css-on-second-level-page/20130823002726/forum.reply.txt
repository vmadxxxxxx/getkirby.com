Text: The best way to include the stylesheet is by using the css-helper, it automatically turns your link into an absolute path, but you won't get into problems in case you move your site later, e.g.:

    <?php echo css('assets/styles/styles.css') ?>

or

    <?php echo css('path/to/stylesheet') ?>

You may also use this syntax with an absolute url if you want (e.g. in case you refer to ressources not hosted on your server)

    <?php echo css('http:/some.url/path/to/stylesheet.css')?>
