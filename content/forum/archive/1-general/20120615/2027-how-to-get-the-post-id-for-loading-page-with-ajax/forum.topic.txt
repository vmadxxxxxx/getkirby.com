Text: Hey there again.
I am porting my portfolio from wordpress to kirby and I had my projects loading with ajax.

I was using this code:


	$(document).ready(function(){
	$.ajaxSetup({cache:false});
	$(".portfolioGrid a").click(function(){
		var post_id = $(this).attr("rel");
		$("#resultsContainer").html("loading...");
		$("#resultsContainer").load("http://<?php echo $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]; ?>/triqui-ajax/",{id:post_id}).slideDown();
		return false;
	});
});

I got this online somewhere and I had also a template called triqui-ajax. the jquery was getting a variable ( id) from the rel atribute on the link and that was placed there with a built in function that wordpress has.

My question is if there is any way of knowing the ID of a post on kirby so I can load the correct content on the template?

thank you again!
