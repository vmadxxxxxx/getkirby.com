Text: Is it possible to do an if/else statement with my environment configs? i want my local dev env. to use separate scripts/CSS and the public site to use concatenated & minified versions from gulp.

right now i just comment and uncomment the sections as needed but i think it would be pretty cool to be able to have it more automated.

thanks!
