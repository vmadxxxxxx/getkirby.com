I just purchased a license and I'm looking forward to finishing up my new site. 

Just curious, is it possible to hide specific images from being called when using this?

```
<?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" />
<?php endforeach ?>
```

To my understanding, this will call all images in the directory. Is it possible to amend the code so it ignores files labeled cover.jpg or preview.jpg?
