Text: Hi There,

I have a dropdown menu where the actual page doesn't display - just it's parent and it's ultimate parent like this:
```
|_Home
|_Shop
  |_Sheets
  |_Bedspreads
|_About
|_Contact
```
But when on a sheet product page for example, I need an active class to appear on "Sheets" and "Shop" so I can indicate to the user where they are in the site.

I've built the menu using the 'Simple nested menu' [here](http://getkirby.com/blog/fun-with-menus) and can see that you find the open item at the root level and it's visible children like this:
```
if($root = $pages->findOpen()) {
  
  // get visible children for the root item
  $items = $root->children()->visible();   
}
```
But don't understand how this could be used to display an active class - any pointers would be much appreciated.

Cheers
