Text: Hi, thanks for the reply. Actually, my question is not related to the Thumb plugin. Sorry for the confusion, I should have used a different name. What I am trying to achieve is this: 

I have several folders, each of them containing several images. In the project.txt of each folder, I have a field called 'thumb', which contains the name of one image in the folder. For example 'thumb: 01.jpg'. 

I want to pass this field as a variable, so that: 

<code>$article->files()->find($var)->url();</code>
and <code>$var = $article->thumb();</code> which outputs '01.jpg'.

It works when I use $var = '01.jpg' but not when I pass the name of the image as a variable. I was wondering if  <code>$page->files->find()</code> does not support variable at all or if I am just missing something simple?

Hope this makes more sense, 
Thanks
