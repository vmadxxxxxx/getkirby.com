Text: I don't believe it is possible with just KirbyText.
One way of doing this would be to enable MarkdownExtra in your config:

```php
c::set('markdown.extra', true);
```
and then [check out the docs...](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/). 

Please mark you query as solved if you are happy.
