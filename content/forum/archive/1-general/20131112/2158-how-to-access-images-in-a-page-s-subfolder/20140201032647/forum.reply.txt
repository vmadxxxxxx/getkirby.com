Text: Sorry - I am quite the noob. I am trying to show an image from a subpage, but I don't quite get it. 

I have this:

$imagepage = $page->children()->first()
$images = $imagepage->images()             
echo ($images)

which shows the correct url of the first (and only) image in the subfolder. How do I show the actual image on the page? 

I hope you can help,
Br, B
