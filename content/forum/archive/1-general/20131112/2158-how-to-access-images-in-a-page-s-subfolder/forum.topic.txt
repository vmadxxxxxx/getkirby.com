Text: Hi all,

I'm working on a Carousel gallery, and trying to figure out how to access all the images in a page's subfolder. So imagine the page is called carousel:

..01-carousel
....carousel.txt
..../detail/
......image1.jpg
......image2.jpg
......image3.jpg

I guess what I'm looking for is something like the **$page->images()** function, but targeting only the images in the **/detail** subfolder, not the page's folder. Here is my code so far (working fine with the images in the page folder, but I want only the images in /detail):

	<?php $n=0; foreach($page->images() as $image): $n++; ?>
	<div class="item<?php if($n==1) echo ' active' ?>">
		<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo html($image->title()) ?>" class="img-responsive" />

Is this possible? Thanks so much for any help you can offer!
