Text: I have not tested your code but we use the range(XX) variable to limit the number of entries. An odd number seems best ;-)

It does not always center, just when you have enough either side in your list. If not it just shows the first/end few as I have shown above. I think it works enough.

```php 
pagination()->range(5)
```
