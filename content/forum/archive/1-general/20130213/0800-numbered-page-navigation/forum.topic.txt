Text: Is it possible to create a numbered navigation system to display at the base of a paginated post list? For example, I have set up my blog to display ten posts per page. Each list/page is then followed by:

    Older Posts … Newer posts

What I’d like to use is:

    Older 1 2 3 4 … 14 15 16 17 Newer
