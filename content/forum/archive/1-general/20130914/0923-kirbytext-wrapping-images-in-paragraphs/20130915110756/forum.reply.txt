Text: The problem is not only inherent in Kirby but other CMS as well. There are some solutions out for Wordpress using a preg_replace pattern that might be adapted to work with Kirby.

The easiest solution at the moment is to wrap the image in a div, even if that means using html-tags within the markdown document. Sometimes that can't be avoided anyway, especially if you need to use classes with paragraphs etc.

Another workaround is to remove the p tags around images using the jQuery unwrap() function.

But I hope the problem will be addressed in Kirby 2.0
