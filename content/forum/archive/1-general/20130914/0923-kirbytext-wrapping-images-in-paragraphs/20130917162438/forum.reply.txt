Text: You could just write a customer helper function, put it in your `plugins` folder.

I have one that looks like this:

    function kirbytext_no_p($text) {
      return str_replace(array('<p>', '</p>'), '', kirbytext($text));
    }

In my case, it's a single image and extreme case. For your case, you'd need to do regex replace to only remove `<p>` tags that surround images.
