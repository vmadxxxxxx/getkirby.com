Text: Hey,

I was wondering if there is a way to prevent kirbytext not outputting images in text inside paragraphs? I have a situation that when I have for example two paragraphs like this:

```
<p>This is paragraph number 1</p>
<p><img src="#"></p>
<p>This is paragraph number 2</p>
```

The image gets it's own set of paragraphs (because of the line breaks in the text file I think). The way I would like it would be:

```
<p>This is paragraph number 1</p>
<img src="#">
<p>This is paragraph number 2</p>
```

Because I would like to set the images widths wider than the paragraphs and can't really work it out properly if they're inside a paragraph.
