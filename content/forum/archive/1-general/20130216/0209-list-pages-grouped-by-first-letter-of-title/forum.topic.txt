Text: Hello,

The site I’m building with Kirby contains many pages (eventually thousands in fact, if all goes to plan). I have a set of index pages, and as the site grows, I’d like to group them by the first letter of their title, e.g.:

**A**
- Abbey Wood
- Acton
- Addiscombe Road
- Adisham

**B**
- Barking
- Barnham
- Battersea Park
- Battle

Currently, my template mark-up is as follows:

```php
<section>
    <h1><?php echo smartypants($page->title()) ?></h1>
    <?php 
        $open = $pages->findOpen();
        $items = ($open) ? $open->children->sortBy('title', 'asc')->visible() : false;
    ?>
    <?php if($items && $items->count()): ?>
    <ul class="stations listing">
        <?php foreach($items AS $item): ?>
        <li><a href="<?php echo $item->url() ?>"><?php echo smartypants($item->title()) ?></a></li>
        <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>
    <?php endif ?>
</section>
```

I see no obvious why of getting the intended results. Anybody tried something similar? How might I accomplish this?

Cheers,

Paul
