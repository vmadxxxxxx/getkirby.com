Text: Hello everyone,
I got the idea to put a slideshow at my frontpage
like there: (link: http://www.michalchelbin.com text: example)

But there is some problems, that i can´t solve.

I use the Kirby Default Theme and wanted to put the sideshow instead of 
a text, for this purpose I put into: **kirby/content/home/home.txt**
following Kirbytext: **(gallery: 01.jpg, 02.jpg, 03.jpg)**

The images 01.jpg, 02.jpg, 03.jpg are in the same folder: 
**kirby/content/home/**

Before to do that I have done following procedure: 

copied the code of this gist (link: https://gist.github.com/1711983)
and placed it in: **site/plugins** and called it **kirbytext.extended.php**

added a new gallery.php snippet in: **site/snippets** with following code 

(image: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8479219864_7624a1705c_o.png)

but what I got is, all 3 pictures on my frontpage without any slideshow
