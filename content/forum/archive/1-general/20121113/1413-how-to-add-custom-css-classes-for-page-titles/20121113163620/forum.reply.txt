Text: Not sure what you are after but you could add a class to a menu snippet, below is a simplified example using the page uid as the class. You probably want a bit more in it than this ;-)

	<nav id="menu" role="navigation">
	<ul>
	<?php foreach($pages->visible() AS $p): ?>
	<li><a href="<?php echo $p->url() ?>" class="<?php echo $p->uid() ?>"><?php echo html($p->title()) ?></a></li>
	<?php endforeach ?>
	</ul>
	</nav>

Another option maybe to put the class on the body if you want to target the whole page?
