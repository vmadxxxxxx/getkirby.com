I think it’s the rewrite thing. I turned it of and it runs, but http://www.biomagnetik.com/index.php/de/firma/management isn’t a smart url.

I did’nt install the new panel, but there was another issue: the info (Copyright, etc.) doesn't show up anymore.

Edit: Ok, the 404s…-guy brought me to an idea: I copied the invisible .htaccess-file in my root directory, now it work‘s fine! But the panel still doesn’t work well.
