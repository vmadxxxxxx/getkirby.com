Text: Hey,

I tried to upload the kirby cmsto www.biomagnetik.com and the  language support is true, there is no subfolder and rewrite url is true. The site directs to www.biomagnetik.com/de 

When I turn off rewrite, it works, but there are ugly urls like /de/index.php.

Does anyone know a solution for that issue?
