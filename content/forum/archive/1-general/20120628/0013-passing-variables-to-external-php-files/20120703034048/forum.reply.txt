Text: That does sound promising.  I got around it current by POST'ing the variables to a config.php file in the assets folder, but the template system is handier.

How would you have one template pass page variables to another? As in - if there is a template "1" pointing to this juicebox template "2", I'd need the variables of page "1" to pass through this external request.

Hope that makes sense.  Kirby has been great so far!
