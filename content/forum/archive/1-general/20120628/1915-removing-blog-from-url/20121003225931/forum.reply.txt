With **uid()** tagcloud plugin doesn't work well.

Process:
1. Open tag "Design" in tagcloud
2. See result for specific tag
3. Open some article from result

Kirby show a different url path:
```
http://site:8888/tag:Design/article-name
```

Without **uid()** Kirby show a normal link with "blog/":
```
http://site:8888/blog/article-name
```

Also 301 redirect for eliminate "blog/" it's not awesome for SEO.
Bastian please tell me if there are any solution ♥
