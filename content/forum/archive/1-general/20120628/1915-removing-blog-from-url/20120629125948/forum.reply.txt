Text: Since you set the blog to be your homepage, you already can access your articles without "blog" in the URL. Just give it a try :)

You can add a simple rule to your htaccess (right before the closing </IfModule>):

```
RedirectMatch 301 ^/blog/(.*)$ /$1
```
This will make sure that URLs with blog will be redirected to the blog-less version. 

I hope this helps.
