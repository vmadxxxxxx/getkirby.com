Text: I'm looking for a way to remove "bog" from my url. This most likely has to be done with an .htaccess file.

Currently my site is: http://blog.anthonyterrell.com, though when you view and article it becomes http://blog.anthonyterrell.com/blog/articlename. So it's a bit redundant.

Any ideas?

Thanks!
