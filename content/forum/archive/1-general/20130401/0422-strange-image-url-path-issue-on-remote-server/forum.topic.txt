Text: I'm having this strange issue **only** on a remote server (of a web hosting company):

When I do this:

```php
<?php echo $image->url() ?>
```

It returns:

```
/content03-products01-tarts01-tart1/P5200572.jpg
```

**the slashes between folder names being stripped.**

So far I don't see a way to fix this. Apart from moving to a different hosting company?

Anyone familiar with an issue like this?
