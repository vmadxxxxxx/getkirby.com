Text: My site and panel both load perfectly, but none of the links work. I get this sort of error whenever I click a link:

"The requested URL /test/panel/show:content/do:add-page was not found on this server."

- .htaccess is uploaded and my only modification was changing the RewriteBase to "/test"
- 755 permissions didn't work for the content and thumbs directories, so I had to use 757
- Running Ubuntu 12.04, Apache/2.2.22 and PHP 5.3.10 
- I confirmed that mod_rewrite is enabled

Can someone please help me?
