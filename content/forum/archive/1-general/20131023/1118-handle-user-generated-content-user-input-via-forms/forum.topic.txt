Text: Hello

I was wondering how to handle user generated content or user input via forms. For example this forum.

What is the best way to let users fill in some forms on my website and save/handle that data. I'd also want to be able to control the data in the Kirby panel (for example administration, approval, ...).

Anyone who can help me out?

Thanks in advance!
