Text: I wanted the same thing and in my posts I split my articles into sections like this

       Title:too bar
       ----
       Excerpt: lorem ipsum more is lumpem roli sump
       -----
       Text: the rest of the article ...

Then in the template loop that lists the articles I used 

         kirbytext($post->excerpt);

 and in the main post template I used
 
         kirbytext($post->excerpt); 
         kirbytext($post->text);
