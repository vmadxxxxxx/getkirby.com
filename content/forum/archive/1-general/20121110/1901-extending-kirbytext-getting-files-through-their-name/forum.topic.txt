Text: I've been extending kirbytext, because I need a few more tags and shortcut very specific to a typography-heavy, grid-based contents.

All my custom kirbytext tags went OK until I had to work on image tags.

To get this result :

    <a href="a-big-image.png" class="lightbox_reactive aside pull-by-one"><img src="a-pretty-thumbnail.png" /><br />Look, you can click it!</a>

I want to write a kirbytext tag like this :

    (lightboxlink: a-big-image legend:Look, you can click it! class: aside pull-by-one)

The problem is that I don't know :

* how to access to the image url & metadata, with only its name (like I would get with `$file-name()` in a template)
* how to call the thumbnail url, based on the image name, url or whatever

Thanks in advance !
