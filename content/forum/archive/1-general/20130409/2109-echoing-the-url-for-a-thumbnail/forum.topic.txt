Text: Hi, I'm building a page that's image / resource intensive and which will be populated by image thumbnails that link to the full size image in a lightbox. Because the page is resource-intensive I would like to use lazy loading in conjunction with the thumbnail plugin.

I just need to use the thumbnail plugin to generate the thumbnails at a specified size and echo the completed image url rather than echoing the completed tag.

Is that possible with the plugin as written? E.g. 

    data-original=“<?php echo $image->url() ?>”

... needs to echo the thumbnail URL rather than the raw image URL.

    <a class="lightbox" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><img data-original=“<?php echo $image->url() ?>” src=“img/placeholder.png” /></a>
