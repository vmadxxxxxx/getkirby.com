Text: Yes, it's possible. Here's a snippet from (link: http://getkirby.com/blog/thumb-plugin text: Bastian's blog post about the thumb plugin):

"If you need the raw url instead of the entire image tag, you can pass false as the third agrument:"

```php
<?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200), false) ?>
// this will echo the raw url of the thumbnail
```
