Text: We love Kirby Panel, but use Kirby CMS with a PHP file manager is a good solution too. We are finishing the first website with Kirby CMS + (link:http://www.file-gator.com/ text:FileGator), we had a very good experience, and the client is very satisfied.

Somebody has used another Kirby CMS + PHP File manager combo?
