Text: I wonder if we're running different versions of Kirby, because that's pretty much what I have.

Sometimes find returns an array when it seems it should only return one item (not sure why or when, but I run into it sometimes), so you could try adding another foreach loop like this:

    $work = $pages->find('work');
    foreach($work as $project):
    foreach($project->children()->visible() as $whatever):

Syntax probably isn't all there, but you get the idea.
