Text: I'm setting up a site with two different views for the same content - a list view and a grid view. I'm wondering (if it's possible) how you can query another page and it's children from a different template.

So far I thought this would work, but hasn't been successful:

<?php $work = $pages->find('work'); foreach($work->children()->visible() as $project): ?>

Any ideas?

Cheers,
