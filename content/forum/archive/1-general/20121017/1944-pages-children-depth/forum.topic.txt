Text: Hello all, 

I am making my first kirby site. Enjoying so far, but have hit a block now. 

My site (not yet public) has a three level structure. so content --> folder --> folder --> folder --> article. On the homepage of the site/blog I would like to show pages from all depths. When I use: 

>> <?php $articles = $pages->children()->visible()->flip()->sortBy($sort='date', $direction='desc')->paginate(5) ?>


I get only a depth of two-levels. How do I get more levels of depth in children()?

Thanks for all the suggestions in advance, 

Prayas
