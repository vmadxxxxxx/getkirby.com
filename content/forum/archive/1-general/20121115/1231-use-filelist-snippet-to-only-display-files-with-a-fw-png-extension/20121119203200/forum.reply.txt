Text: You might be able to use the recent filtering changes to modify it. You could change this line in the snippet:

    $files = $page->files();

To this:

    $files = $page->files()filterBy('title', '!=', '.fw');

I assume that Kirby only recognizes the .png as the extension, so the .fw should show up as part of the title. If that doesn't work, though, you could try:

    $files = $page->files()filterBy('extension', '!=', '.fw');

which would filter by extension. You may also need to leave out the period in the matching pattern and just do 'fw'.
