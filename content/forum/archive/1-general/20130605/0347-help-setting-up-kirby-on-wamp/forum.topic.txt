Text: I'm trying to get Kirby running locally with WAMP so I can take a look at it and get familiar with it, but I'm running into a problem. When I visit the Kirby index page, it says **Missing mbstring functions**

I've enabled the mbstring extension in WAMP so I'm not really sure what I'm missing. If someone could walk me through getting Kirby running on a fresh WAMP install, I'd appreciate it.
