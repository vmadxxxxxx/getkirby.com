Text: Easy part first: for the primary loop, just call visible items and make the one you want to skip invisible.

I'm not quite understanding the other question. I THINK what you're asking is how to call a specific page and make a loop of its children. Easy enough:

```php
<?php $events = $pages->find('/events')->children()->visible() ?>
```

Then just loop through the events as normal. Take a look at the cheat sheet. It might help.
