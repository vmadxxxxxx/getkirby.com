Text: Hi, 

I'd like to have a sidebar which is editable in the Panel, but is common to all pages on the site (where it's included in the template). 

I can't get my head around how to structure the content folder, templates etc so this works. 

I understand I can create a snippet for the sidebar and include that in the templates, but that would be hard coded. I want to be able to edit the content in the Panel. 

For example, I'd like to have a paragraph or two of "About" text in the sidebar which I can edit from the Panel. 

I thought perhaps I could create a global variable in the site.txt and edit it there, but I'm sure there's a more flexible way...

How would I go about doing this?

Cheers!
