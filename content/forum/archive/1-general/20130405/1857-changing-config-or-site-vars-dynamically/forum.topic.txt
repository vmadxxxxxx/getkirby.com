Text: Hi—

I was wondering wether it’s possible to change the content of the site.txt or the config ‘dynamically’.
I have to save the current time and some other information.

I’d like to do something like this, but it doesn’t seem to work… :(

    if(c::get('lastRequest', false) == false) {
      c::set('lastRequest', time());
    }

Any other ideas on how to handle this problem? If not I’ll have to store the information in a separate text file and extract it manually, but I’d prefer a solution using Kirby.

Thanks in advance!
