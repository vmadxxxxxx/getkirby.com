Text: Okay, checked this tutor out

http://getkirby.com/blog/one-pager

Looks like I redirect all pages using the default.php template file to block the access and can also use .htaccess:

http://getkirby.com/blog/protect-your-content-files

Now to fetch a page content, do I have to use 

$pages->findByUID($uid)

or is there a way to store a content as block and call it using the snippet() function?


Thank you!
