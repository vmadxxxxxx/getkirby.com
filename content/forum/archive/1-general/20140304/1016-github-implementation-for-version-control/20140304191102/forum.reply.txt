Text: I use git along with (link: https://github.com/mislav/git-deploy text: git-deploy) for pushing via SSH/SFTP. Allows you to deploy using something like `git push production master`.

You can keep a copy on github as well, but github won't serve it. Or you could bypass github altogether and just use your servers.

You can also have multiple remotes set up with the git-deploy script. I have a staging server that is checked out to the staging branch, so I can do `git push staging staging`. I also have github set up as the default repo, so I push there with `git push origin master` or `git push origin staging` so the branches are there for safe keeping.
