Text: Hi, I now have a site up and running fine in hostgator [here](www.jackylee.co)

However I'm wondering if there's a way I can get away from hostgator and use github for hosting my site. I've crawled everywhere on google but found out that pages.github does not support php... 

I would like to find out how to deploy changes / new posts to my kirby site WITHOUT FTP. And preferably also have version control like github... Has anyone out there have a solution for this? I find FTP to be kinda clunky when I have multiple files that needs overwrite.

Cheers!
