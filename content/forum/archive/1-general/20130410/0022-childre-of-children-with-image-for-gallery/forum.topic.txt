Text: I know this is my third post in less than a week. I'm really sorry for that but i'm stuck again.

Here is my inquiry, I have a main folder, it appear as a menu section of the site,  in that folder there is two other folders that appear as a submenu, in those folder there is many other folders with images in it to appear as a gallery. I was able to show the children as a gallery but not the children of the children.

```
main folder
 subfolder1
   sub-subfolder1
      img1
      img2
      img3
   sub-subfolder2 
      img1
      img2
      img3 
  sub-subfolder3
      img1
      img2
      img3
```
***

that the code i use to show the first children's
```
<?php foreach($page->children as $gallery): ?>

<div class="gallery">

  <h4><?php echo $gallery->title() ?></h4>
  
  <ul>
    <?php foreach($gallery->images() as $image): ?>
    <li>
      <a rel="<?php echo $gallery->uid() ?>" href="<?php echo $image->url() ?>"><?php echo thumb($image, array('width' => 200, 'height' => 200, 'crop' => true)) ?></a>
    </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  </ul>

</div>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

Thx for the eventual reply.
