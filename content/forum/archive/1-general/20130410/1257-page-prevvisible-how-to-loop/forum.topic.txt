I am coding a portfolio. When you view a project you can browse through all the other projects. Therefore i used this code:

	<?php if($page->hasPrevVisible()): ?>
	<a href="<?php echo $page->prevVisible()->url() ?>">previous</a>
	<?php endif ?>


This solution works pretty well but now i want to loop this. If you are viewing the last project the link shoult point to the first item, something like:
> $page->firstVisible()->url()

How do I do that? Thanks!
