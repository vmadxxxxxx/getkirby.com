Text: This is my code:

    <?php foreach(str::split($page->tags()) as $tag): ?>
        <li><a href="<?php echo url('tag:' . urlencode($tag)) ?>">&#35;<?php echo $tag; ?></a></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>

I didn't know where to use sort, I tried:

     <?php echo sort($tag); ?>

but that didn't work.
