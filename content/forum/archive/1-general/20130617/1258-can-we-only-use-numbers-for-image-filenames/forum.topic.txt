Text: The Kirby documentation says that it 'recommends' just using numbers instead of filenames but it seems that images can only have filenames that are numbers. 

I hoped that I would be able to use filenames that were prepended by numbers i.e. 01-filename.jpg

This does not appear to work. Files do not show for me when filenames contain anything more than a number.Is there a way to allow this? I want to use descriptive filenames that will help Google Search monitor the images.

I am not using the Kirby Panel. Does the use of this allow greater control of filenames?

Thanks. Matt
