Text: Hi,

I'm adding images to posts using:

<pre>
( - image: 001.jpg alt: alt text - )
</pre>

But the html outputted is wrapping the image in a p tag. This is problematic for me as I'm using max-width on the p element. Is there any way to have an image added within the content txt but not wrapping p tags around it?

Thanks,
J
