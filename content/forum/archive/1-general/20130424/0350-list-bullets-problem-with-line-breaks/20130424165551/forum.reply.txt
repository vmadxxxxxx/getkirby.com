Text: Getting closer now. However, following your suggestion to remove these lines also changes the navigation menu.

Menu with original CSS - <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/184602/Original%20CSS.png>

Modified CSS - <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/184602/Modified%20CSS.png>

I have tried changing padding from 0px to other numbers but I can't get the menu items to be even between two horizontal lines.

    }
    nav {
      overflow: hidden;
      border-top: 1px solid green;
      border-bottom: 1px solid green;
      padding: 0px 0;
    }

Update:

Would this be a correct way to fix the navigation menu lines?

    }
    nav {
      overflow: hidden;
      border-top: 1px solid green;
      border-bottom: 1px solid green;
      padding: 0px 0 10px 0;
    }
