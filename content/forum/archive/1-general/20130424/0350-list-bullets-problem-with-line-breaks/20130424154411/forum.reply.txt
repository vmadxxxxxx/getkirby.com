Text: @staroversky, by original css, I'm assuming you meant the basic design shipped with kirby. If you look at the `styles.css`, it has this in the first line: 
	
	* {
	  margin: 0px;
	  padding: 0px;
	}

This line removes margins in lists so you may want to edit the CSS to get it to work the way you want it to. It's definitely not a bug though :D. A suggestion would be to remove this line for now and see what happens.
