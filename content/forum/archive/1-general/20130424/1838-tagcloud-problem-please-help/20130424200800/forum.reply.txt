Not that CSS (or even HTML) questions aren’t welcome here, but this is the forum for Kirby, which is a CMS. So the bulk of the content you’ll find on here is related to Kirby functionality and PHP stuff, not–so–much CSS.

Kirby is much different from WordPress in that most everything comes ready out–of–box with WordPress, such as adding a tag cloud. I see Kirby as more do–it–yourself.

I would try something like this:

Add a `class` of `tagcloud` to the `ul` element that houses your tag list.

Then add the following CSS:

```css

.tagcloud li {
  float: left;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0 3px 3px 0;
}

.tagcloud li a {
  background: #222;
  border-radius: 20px;
  display: block;
  font-size: 13px;
  height: 20px;
  line-height: 20px;
  padding: 0 10px;
}

```
