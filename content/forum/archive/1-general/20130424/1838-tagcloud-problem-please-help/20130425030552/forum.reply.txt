Text: If I’m understanding you correctly, you’re wanting the whole tag cloud to be a tall vertical list on the left *just* like how the Kirby blog is?

If so, getkirby.com isn’t the same ‘theme’ that comes with the default Kirby install, so you need to hire a web designer/developer or learn HTML & CSS to do things like this. I made them look like clickable tags for you, but at this point you’re requesting free work ;-)

This forum is more meant for solving issues or helping find a solution to things with Kirby.
