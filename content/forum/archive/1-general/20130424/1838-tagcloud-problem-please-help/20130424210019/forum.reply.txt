Text: Thank you for the reference links. I will definitely start learning the basics.

At the moment:

My CSS with your added code - <http://pastebin.com/MYaefbMi>

default.php template - <http://pastebin.com/PUh1Y2Em>

The end result is that nothing has changed. The tags are displayed as bullets just like you see in the screenshots in the previous post. 

Does it matter where specifically I insert tagcloud code into the default.php?

Please advise.
