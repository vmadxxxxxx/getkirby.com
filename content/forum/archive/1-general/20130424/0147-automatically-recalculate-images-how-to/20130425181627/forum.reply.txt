Text: Got it working. The mistake that I made was simply adding this code to the end of my css file.

     img {
       max-width: 100%;
     }

Instead, I added to to this section

     img {
     	max-width: 100;
     	outline: 0;
     	border: 0;
     }

Thank you for your help. On top of the book that you recommended about HTML and CSS, I think that these sites are a good start too:
