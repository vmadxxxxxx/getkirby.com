On this page: http://getkirby.com/docs/media

I see this code:

****

	<?php $image = $page->images()->find('01.jpg')->fitWidth(200) ?>
	
	<img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" width="<?php echo $image->width() ?>" height="<?php echo $image->height() ?>" />

****

I can't figure out where specifically do I insert this code so that all the images that I post on my blog (and pages) will be recalculated just like they are resized in Wordpress? I know that recalculate and resize are different.

Thanks.
