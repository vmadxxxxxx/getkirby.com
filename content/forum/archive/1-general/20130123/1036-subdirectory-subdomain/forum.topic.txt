Text: i would like to use kirby for powering a website which would have different sections that are not related to others. the sections would be stored in their own folders and share the same kirby install. but i don't want the users to be access parts by /part instead by entering a subdomain.

like:

domain.com/section1 to be accessible at section1.domain.com
domain.com/section2 -> section2.domain.com

and kirby installed on the root
