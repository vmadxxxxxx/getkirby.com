Text: Hey guys,

I'm developing a new site for a club. All members will have their own login data, that they could check some protected data, dates etc. The login formular should be on the homepage ("/"), so after the login I want to redirect the user to another, protected homepage ("/intern"). But if I am logged in and want to visit the homepage ("/")), I'm getting redirected to the protected homepage ("/intern") again. Is it possible to redirect the user only after the login form get's submitted, but if he's visiting the homepage ("/") again, it doesn't?

I don't want to make an extra login page, maybe you have some other guesses/tipps? Thanks a lot!

My home.php template (if you need it):


	<? snippet("header") ?>
    
	<section class="box">
        <? $login = Auth::login("/intern") ?>
        
        <? if($login): ?>
        <p class="error">Error :(</p>
        <? endif ?>
        <form action="<?=$page->url() ?>#login" method="post" class="login" id="login">
            <input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="User">
            <input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="Password">
            <input type="submit" name="submit" id="submit" value="Login">
        </form>
    </section>
    
	<? snippet("footer") ?>
