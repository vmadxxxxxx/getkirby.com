Text: Hi folks,

Hopefully just a quick one.

Within the blueprint for a template, I have two simple text fields set up:

    builtwith:
      label: Built with
      type:  text  
    builtat:
      label: Built at
      type:  text
  
For any one project I add via the Panel, only one of these two fields are ever going to be filled out. So, I thought it would make sense to wrap these two fields, in the template file, in an if statement.

    <?php if ( $website->builtwith() ) : ?>
      <p class="built-with">Built with <?php echo $website->builtwith() ?></p>
    <?php endif; ?>
    <?php if ( $website->builtat() ) : ?>
      <p class="built-at">Built at <?php echo $website->builtat() ?></p>
    <?php endif; ?>

However, even if one of the fields are blank, it still returns the contents within the if that is 'not true'.

Any ideas? I've used Advanced Custom Fields for WP and it follows the same method.

Thanks in advance,
