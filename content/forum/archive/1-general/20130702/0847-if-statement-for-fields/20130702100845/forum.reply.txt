Text: Yes, thank you! I was curious to know if you get 'get' the field... and if it was blank it wouldn't follow. I know this isn't Advanced Custom Fields, but they adopt a simple 'get value', if value is blank then skip. For this they have two options...

    <?php get_the_field(''); ?>
and
    <?php the_field(''); ?>

So, to check if the field is empty or not we would write

    <?php if ( get_the_field('') ) : ?>
      <?php the_field(''); ?>
    <?php endif; ?>

Anyway, your help has solved this — but something similar to this would be super useful for future releases :)

Many thanks,
