Text: This is not really to do with KirbyCMS ;-)

I do not know this plugin but judging by the demo you will probably have to load (in your template)

+ eventCalendar.css
+ eventCalendar_theme_responsive.css
+ jquery.min.js (1.9.1)
+ jquery.timeago.js
+ jquery.eventCalendar.min.js
+ Some jQuery to set it up as per the demo.
