Text: In this case I'd suggest to write your custom classes directly into your markdown file just like you would do it in a regular .html file.

```html
<p class="intro">Your awesome intro text.</p>
```

That will work in combination with regular markdown generated paragraphs as well:

```html

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer... 

<p class="intro">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer...</p>
```

The output would be:

```html

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer...</p>

<p class="intro">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer...</p>
```

Another solution for some kind of "intro" (in your special case) could be an extra field to define some text which will be displayed by something like:

```php

<?php echo kirbytext($page->intro()) ?>

```

while your markdown file would be:

```html
----
intro: your awesome intro text
----
```
