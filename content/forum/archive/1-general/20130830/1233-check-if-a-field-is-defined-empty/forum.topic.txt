Text: I might be missing something obvious here.

I am displaying content like this:

	<ul>
		<li><?php echo html($person->twitter()) ?></li>
		<li><?php echo html($person->website()) ?></li>
	</ul>

Problem is that not all fields are defined for every person (who are updating themselves using the panel). Not everybody has a twitter account for example, and they leave the Twitter box empty.

This results in superfluous markup however, empty list elements and whatnot.

I have tried with if-statements

	<?php if($person->twitter()): ?>
		<li><?php echo html($person->twitter()) ?></li>
	<?php endif ?>

but that isn't working.

Thanks!
