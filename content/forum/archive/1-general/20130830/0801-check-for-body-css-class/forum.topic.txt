Text: Does anybody know a good way to check with kirby/php to see if an element (in this case the body) has a specific css class assigned to it? 

Basically I would like to check to see if a class is assigned on the body tag in my header snippit (there I have things like class="<?php echo $page->uid() ?>" or class="<?php echo browser::css() ?>" etc. ) and if it does exist then I would print out some additional html in my template file.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. 

Thanks,

Kevin
