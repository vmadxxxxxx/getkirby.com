Text: Hello all, 
I'm not sure if I'm missing something simple or I've tripped up on something not-so-simple. Is there a straight forward way to query for all of the pages with a date greater than today? 

For example when dealing with pages as events, I want to be able to query for "upcoming" events forgoing any with a start date prior to today.

Thanks in advance for any insight.
