Text: Hey,

you get this error, because you call `$sub_sections->findOpen();` while `$sub_section` seems to be false I guess. So it's not an object. I am not familiar with how findOpen() works, but what exactly are you trying to do here? Just identifying the current page? 

There might be several small logical errors in your code. At least you have to make sure that `$sub_section` is definitely not false when calling an object function on it.
