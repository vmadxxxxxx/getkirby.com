Text: So I installed the default Kirby package... no real problems there.

Now I would like change to the "knowledge base" templating system... but I am getting lost, I'm afraid.  

Can someone give me a more precise step-by-step than what I have found in the blog (that one seems to be missing some steps)

Thanks!
