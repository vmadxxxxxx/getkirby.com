Text: Not sure if this would be a Kirby problem? 
Can you turn off CSS styles in your Android browser, do you see the p tags? If so probably browser/css and maybe HTML structure related?

1. Likely not the problem but it is always worth checking for valid code before investigating possible CSS problems. On validating html on the link you sent:


		Error Line 52, Column 4: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen.


2. Also try removing the font stuff and just go with generic fonts (available on adroid?) in your CSS?
  

Maybe try some CSS something like:

	html {
		font-size: 100%; /* 1 */
		-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; /* 2 */
		-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%; /* 2 */
		font-family: sans-serif;
		}
  
I have no android and my emulator seems to have gone on the blink, so a bit stuck on checking any of this.
