Text: Hey Tyson, 

so sorry for my late reply. 

As far as I understand it you need to filter your articles first and afterwards sort the result set. Did you try something like this: 

```php

$articles $pages->find('pressarticles')
  ->children()
  ->filterBy('featured', 'on')
  ->sortBy('date', 'desc');

```

To filter for missing text should also be possible by adding an additional filterBy: 

```php

$articles $pages->find('pressarticles')
  ->children()
  ->filterBy('featured', 'on')
  ->filterBy('text', '')
  ->sortBy('date', 'desc');

```

I hope this helps.
