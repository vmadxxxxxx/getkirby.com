Since you only need the main content without footer and header for the ajax result, you can do something like: 

```
<?php if(!r::is_ajax()) snippet('header') ?>

<!-- your main content goes here -->

<?php if(!r::is_ajax()) snippet('footer') ?>
```

haven't tried that together with history.js yet, but it should work.
