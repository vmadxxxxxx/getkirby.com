Text: 1. Yes, you can upload images in the panel. I'm not entirely sure if you can resize them. You can resize them in the templates I think, if necessary.

2. Yes, when you create an article from the panel, it creates the folder and text file for you assuming you have the permissions all correct on the server.

With the current version of the panel, it gets awkward when you have lots of articles in the same folder.

1. Create article, and it gets created as invisible by default.
2. Drag it to make it visible, and if you have too many articles it just bogs down and doesn't end up in the right spot.

So there are some issues. Hopefully the new panel with Kirby 2 will address those.
