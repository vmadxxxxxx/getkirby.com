Text: Hello Kirbians!
I'm having trouble with the following code:

	<?php if($page->hasImages()): ?>
	<?php foreach($page->images() as $image): ?>
	<div style="background-image:url(<?php echo $image->url() ?>)">  </div>
	<?php endforeach ?>
	<?php endif ?>

The images do not show up. If I use an img tag inside of the div, the images show up fine. It's just when I try putting it as the background-image:url() that the path seems to break.

I don't know why the path isn't working.Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.
