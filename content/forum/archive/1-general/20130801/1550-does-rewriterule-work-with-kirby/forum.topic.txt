Text: Hi,

I'm trying to make a simple RewriteRule so my dynamic page can handle the url as parameter without changing url, this way:

when you access:  /events/holidays-camp
will call the page:  /event/name:holidays-camp

I put this on .htaccess:
RewriteRule ^events/(.*) /event/name:$1 [L]

But I suppose kirby handles urls in another internal way, because it simple dont work. could anyone help me?

thanks!
