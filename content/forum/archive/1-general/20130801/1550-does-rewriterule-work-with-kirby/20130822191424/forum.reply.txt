Text: Looking for a answer too.

I want to put data to a page link... like:

 event/name
or 
 events/23/08/2013 

that should lead me to the event or events page where i
parse the URL und pull data from the DB.

Is there any way or do i need to use the old parameter way like:

event?name=thename  or  events?date=23.08.2013


thanks!
