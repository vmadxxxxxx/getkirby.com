Text: I'm testing Kirby and encountered Notice: Undefined index: ___ in kirby/lib/pages.php and files.php

Nonetheless it runs fine and have no notices in my local MAMP.

PHP version on server is 5.3.10. I'm not sure if it's related to the version. I'm very new to PHP and appreciated if anyone could help.

Thanks!
