Text: Hi,

I would like to add a comment section to my kirby blog. There are two issues holding me back right now:
1. There does not be a sanctioned way by disqus to have multiple different comment fields on one page. Since I would like to have the comments directly underneath my posts on my main page that's a bummer.
2. Even if this would work, I am still not sure about having my comments at some company. Beside the trust issue I really would prefer my comments on my own server.

So my questions:
Is there anyone who has implemented multiple disqus comments on one page?
Is there any way I can store my comments on my server?
