Text: I realise that but what were you expecting to filter them on? 

1. You need to have some key you can filter on.

2. Or you compare arrays as I've mentioned. 

I'd have the same mark-up for both 'featured' and normal 'articles' and just have the tag 'featured' set to 'on' or 'off'? Easy then ;-)
