Text: That's actually very easy :) The built-in "collections" have a first() and last() method, which you can use here. 

```
<?php $partners = $page->children() ?>
<?php $last = $partners->last() ?>
<?php foreach ($partners AS $partner) : ?>
    <?php echo $partner->uid() ?>
    <?php echo ($partner === $last) ? '' : ',' ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

I didn't test it, but it should work.
