Text: First of all, Kirby is excellent! Having a lot of fun working with it.

But I'm running into a problem. I've created text files for different projects

02-projects

* 01-project-a
    * project.en.txt
    * project.fr.txt
* 02-project-b
    * project.en.txt
    * project.fr.txt

etc.

And I have generic page templates in site/templates :
  * project.en.php
  * project.fr.php

And in assets/css/ I have :
  * project.en.css
  * project.fr.css

and a script in header.php to add /en/ or /fr/ before assets/css

It works when not in multilanguge, using project.en.php and project.en.css. But if I put it in multilanguage, $page->template() always returns "default". 

Any ideas ???
