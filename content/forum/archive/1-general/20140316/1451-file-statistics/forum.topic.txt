My client -  a professional photographer - has requested to be able to see who (what ip-number) has viewed each of his photos and how many times.

Is this a statistic Kirby keeps track of, or is there some other way I can access/display this information, preferably from inside the Kirby Panel? Maybe a way to insert the ip-numbers into the image metadata files? My PHP is rusty, so I'd prefer not to edit Kirby's core files, but I'm open for any suggestion.

I think his host is running Apache and has some kind of internally-developed statistics tool (no awstats), but I don't know much about the server side. I'm mainly a front-end guy...
