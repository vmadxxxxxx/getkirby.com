Text: I had a look but could not immediately see the value to set. I was presuming `$page->sex()->value()` or `$page->sex()->text()` but I cannot see the variable required. Perhaps a bug...

Anyway one way would be to do this ;-)
```html
  sex:
    label: Sex
    type: radio
    options:
      Male: Male
      Female: Female
      Other: Other
    default: Female
```
