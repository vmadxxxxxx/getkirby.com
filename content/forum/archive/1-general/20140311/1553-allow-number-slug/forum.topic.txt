Text: I have an old URL that I want to keep if possible.

It looks like this:

    /30-days/
    /90-days/

It has nothing to do with my menu (visible or not). Is it possible to keep my URLS or do I need to redirect?

I found out that this seems to be valid:

    /days/30/
    /days/90/

...but I don't want /days/ to be an archive page and therefor I prefer the first structure.
