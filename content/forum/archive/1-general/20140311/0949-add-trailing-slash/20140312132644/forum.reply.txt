Text: I am no expert on Rewrite conditions, or indeed .htaccess,
but it seems to me that putting this before your other re-write blocks (the normal Kirby ones) should work. Not really tested much and it might cause other problems and I'm not sure anything but directories should have a trailing slash?

```Apache
# Rewrite to add trailing slash to URL
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}|/)$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/$1/ [L,R=301]
```
