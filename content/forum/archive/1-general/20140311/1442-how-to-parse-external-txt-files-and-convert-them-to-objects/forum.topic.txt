Text: I have an external source of my data, which is basically txt-files and are structured exactly like the ones of kirby pages.

How can I parse them so they are converted to objects like the page object? Could not find the logic in the Kirby source code which does that.

So that I can use them like so:
```
$externaltxt = someParseFunction("my-file.txt");
$externaltxt->title();
```
Thanks.
