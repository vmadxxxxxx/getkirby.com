Text: An old thread but relevant for discovering Kirby while looking for a simpler CMS to use for small client sites.

I would argue that it's not about Kirby being a replacement for Wordpress, but more about which of the two is the best tool for a particular job. No one CMS is the right tool for every type of website.
