Text: Hi!

A lot of companies use Wordpress as CMS. They say: "its easy to use; its for free and Wordpress have so many plugins...; We use Wordpress all time, we would never change; ..."

I need some big arguments pro Kirby to change the opinion.

Biggest arguments I think are page speed and the file-based system. No longier trouble with databases.

So, thats your biggest arguments pro Kirby?
I need some more... ;-)
