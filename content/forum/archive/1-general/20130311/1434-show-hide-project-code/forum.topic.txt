Text: Hi everyone,

I'm making a website with a projects thumbnail grid. When the user clicks on a thumbnail I want to show the project contents in a div above the grid using a show/hide plugin.

It's almost working, but I can't seem to figure out what code to use for the div that will show up. I can't use $page, because that returns the content of the parent page. When I use $project, the content of all projects shows up. I'm not sure how to create this for the specific project that is clicked.

Does anybody know how to fix that?

Thanks in advance!
