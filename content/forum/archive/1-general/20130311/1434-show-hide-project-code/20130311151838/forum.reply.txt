Text: Well, it's not so much a Kirby issue as it is an issue of me not fully knowing Kirby (and php).

What I have is this:

	<toggle div>
	Project content
	</toggle div>

	<thumbnail grid>
	Clicking on these thumbnails opens the div
	</thumbnail grid>

My question is: how do I let the toggle div know that it needs to display the project content when the thumbnail of that project is clicked on? I've been playing around with it for a little while now, but I can't seem to figure it out.
