Text: @russbaldwin I understood it that way: @structor has multiple sites with the same template (press.php), but wants to include a snippet based on a field 'Sidepanel' in the content text file (press.txt).

@structor well, just tested it and it works perfectly... my text file:
```
testsnippet: header
```

My template:
```php
<?php snippet($page->testsnippet()) ?>

...
```
