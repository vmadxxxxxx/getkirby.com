Text: I've not tested it, but perhaps a boolean rather than a 'null' would be required? e.g. TRUE or FALSE or maybe even 1 or 0 or even on or off?

I note [the format given in the documents](http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints/field-types) is:

```php
fields: 
  myfield: 
    label:   My Checkbox
    type:    checkbox
    default: on
```

Look at the page array to see what is there...
