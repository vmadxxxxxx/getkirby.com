Text: Hi,

How do I get the url of a page, including, content folder and numbers not omitted?

Example, I have a page structure like this:

    01-home
    02-projects
        01-project1

Now I am trying to get the url for 01-project1 in my template. What I want is:

http://localhost:8888/mysite/content/02-projects/01-project1

So the url should include the content folder as well as numbers in front of the folders. So I put this in my template:

    <?php $path = $page->siblings()->find('projects')->children()->find('project1')->url(); ?>

The result:

http://localhost:8888/mysite/projects/project1

Not what I need, the url has omitted the contents folder as well as the numbers in front of the directories.

Now if I find an image inside 01-project1 I get the url structure I need:

    <?php $pathalt = $page->siblings()->find('projects')->children()->find('project1')->images()->first()->url(); ?>

The result:

http://localhost:8888/mysite/content/02-projects/01-project1/project_1.jpg

Now I need to get rid of the last part of the url to get the directory url. So I do this:

    <?php 
    $dir = explode('/', $pathalt);
    array_pop($dir);
    $newpath = implode('/', $dir);
    ?>

The result:

http://localhost:8888/mysite/content/02-projects/01-project1

So in the end I get the 01-project1 url. But this feels really complex and I think that I am doing it all wrong. So any suggestions of how I can get the url of a page including the content folder and including the numbers without resorting to the above complex solution?

Thanks in advance :)
