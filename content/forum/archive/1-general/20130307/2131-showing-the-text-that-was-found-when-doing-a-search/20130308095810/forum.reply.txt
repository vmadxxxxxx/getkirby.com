Text: thanks. I hadn't cottoned on to the fact that the return array is essentially an array of page objects.

I see the difficult of excerpting a matching snippet , even if I use 'excerpt' it will likely contain kirbytext or markdown which will make it look wrong to the user.

I like the idea of providing a short description for each page (might be good in the meta tags as well) and then using or excerpting that.

Many thanks
