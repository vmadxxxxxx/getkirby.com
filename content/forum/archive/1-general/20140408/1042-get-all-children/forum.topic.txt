Text: Hey guys, sorry, for the life of me I can't figure this out..

I'm trying to echo out all children of a container, my folder layout looks like

```
01-products
   01-drink
      scotch.txt
      vodka.txt
   02-fruit
      apple.txt
   03-dessert
      chocolate.txt
```

I'm running

```
<?php $products = $pages->find('products')->children()->limit(14); ?>
<?php foreach($products as $test): ?>
<?php echo html($test->title()) ?>
<?php endforeach ?>
```

And all I seem to get is

```
scotch
apple
chocolate
```

As my output (missing the second item under drink)

Am I missing something blindingly obvious?
