Text: To find a page, there is a function called

$pages->findByUID()

Is there a function to find a child page? 

I am trying to do something like

if ($pages->findByUID('parent') {
         get the child page...
}

It would be much better if it can retrieve a child page by unique ID directly. Thanks.
