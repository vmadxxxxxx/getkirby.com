Text: Hello Everyone,

I want to switch from Wordpress to Kirby, but I need to be able to run bits of PHP from within a page from time to time. For example, as a professor, I'll give online quizzes that are written in php that are automatically graded and stored so students can login later and see the semester long results.

In WordPress I have these quizzes in each post and have a plugin that allows the PHP to execute. Can I do this in Kirby without linking to an external page that has the quiz (I want one CMS)?

Thanks,
Gary
