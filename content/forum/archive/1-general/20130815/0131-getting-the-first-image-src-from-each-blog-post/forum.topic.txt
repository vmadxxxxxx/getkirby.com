Text: __Original problem__
I'm making a very simple blog, each article will have at least one image. So for the "blog listing" I want to pull the first image of each blog post, wrap it in an anchor tag, as seen everywhere. 

The markup is pretty much "ripped" straight out of the blog tutorial but anyway, here's what I got:

As soon as I try to put anything in the src="" my posts just disappear.

__Above works, new problem__
Okay, so that worked! However here's another problem. If for some reason the user forgets to upload an image, the post doesn't get displayed at all (no PHP errors). Is there a way around that?
