Text: Ok, this might be super basic but I'm really having trouble.

I'm basically trying to build an art-directed blog. I don't want to use markdown so I use the tag `<?php echo $page->text() ?>` in my work.php-template to output raw html from my work.txt.

So far so good. My mark-up and styles show up fine... but getting my images to show up seems to be a bit more complicated.

So how do I link to an image that is in the same folder as my work.txt? `<img src="img.png">` doesn't work.
