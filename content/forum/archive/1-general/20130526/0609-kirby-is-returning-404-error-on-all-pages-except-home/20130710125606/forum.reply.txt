Text: It turns off the nice URL re-writing. 

1. Check your PHP has mod_rewrite enabled if not try and get it enabled with your ISP?

2. Check your .htaccess has the correct stuff in the right place
`RewriteEngine on`
You might also need
`RewriteBase /`
You might want to list it here ;-)

3. If you get all that OK then it should work if you set  `c::set('rewrite', true);`
