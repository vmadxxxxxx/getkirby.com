Text: Hey, 

i´ve setup a kirby website with 3 different languages, actually the url schema is the kirby default: domain.com/de , domain.com/en and domain.com/jp … 
Is there anything built in kirby that i can use to have a seperated TLD for each language like:

domain.com (english site)
domain.de (german site)
domain.jp (japanese site)

The easiest solution would be a simple redirect but that is not perfect.

Thanks guys
