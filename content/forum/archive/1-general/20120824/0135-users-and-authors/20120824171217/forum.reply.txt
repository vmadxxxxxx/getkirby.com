Text: I got a special field for authors on my todo list, but it's not there yet. 

You can pull account information from the frontend, but it will need some extra code. Something like this should work:

```php
<?php

$account = c::get('root.site') . '/panel/accounts/' . $page->author() . '.php';

if(file_exists($author)) {
  $content = f::read($account);
  $author  = yaml($content);

  // $author will be an associative array with all the info you need. 

} else {
  $author = false;
}

?>
```

You could easily put that into a plugin with its own function so it doesn't get in your way in your templates.
