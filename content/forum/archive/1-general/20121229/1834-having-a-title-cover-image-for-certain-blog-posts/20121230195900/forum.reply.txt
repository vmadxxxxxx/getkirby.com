Text: Strange. I just tested out the code on my end and it works.

So let's double check everything:

### Panel

This is working fine? Showing the select box?

### Content File

Content file is showing either the file name of the image you select, nothing, or 0?

### Finally...

Is this not working for you on the home page or on the actual blog post page?

Keep in mind the code I posted above uses the `$page` variable, which will work for doing all this on the actual page *of the blog post*.

If you're trying to pull these into your home page you'll need to `find()` that page first.

Make sense?
