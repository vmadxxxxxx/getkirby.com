Text: Are you using the Kirby Panel? If not, disregard the part about Blueprints below.

Here's what I did for a client site:

### Blueprint

I'm using the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/fields/fileselect text: Fileselect extension) which puts a select field in the Panel to let you pick an uploaded file from the current page. Super easy, but not part of the standard Kirby install.

    hero:
      label: Hero Image
      type: fileselect
      filetype: 
        - image
      empty: Select a Photo


### Content File

The content file is super simple, it either has an image listed or not:

    ----
    Hero: awesome-photo.jpg
    ----

or

    ----
    Hero: 
    ----


### Template

In the template, we first check if the Hero field in the content file is blank *or* has a zero (the fileselect field will output a zero if you unselect a file/image and return it to its 'zero' state). Then, if it isn't blank, it looks in the pages `images()` for that file name and sets it to a variable to use.

    <?php if($page->hero() !='' && $page->hero() !='0'): ?>
        <?php $image = $page->images()->find( html($page->hero()) ) ?>
        <img src="<?php echo $image->url() ?>" alt="<?php echo $image->title() ?>" />
    <?php endif ?>


Hope this makes sense!
