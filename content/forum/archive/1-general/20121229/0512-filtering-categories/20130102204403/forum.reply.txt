Text: Hi there,

You could try to use filterBy().

On page where you want to display your posts from one of the categories include ``<?php $posts = $pages->children()->visible()->filterBy('category', urldecode(param('tag')), ',') ?>`` somewhere before your foreach loop, where ``$posts`` should be changed to whatever name you use in your code. 

And after just use url path as ``www.website.com/blog/tag:your_category_name``.

I did the same in one of mine projects, you can take al look (link:http://share.ignaty.com/0Y2V2f1v3W0h text: here).

Hope that help.
