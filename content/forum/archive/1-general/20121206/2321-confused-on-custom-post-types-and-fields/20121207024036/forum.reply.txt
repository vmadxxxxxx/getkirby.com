Text: The page structure (visible = numbering & invisble = no numbering) is probably the only part I understand at this point.

Anyway, yes I am. Both the 'lettering' and 'type' content will be pulled into the Portfolio page as some sort of grid. Basically I'm going to have thumbnails which will hopefully link to the post page. 

Can you clarify if that structure above will work? Both 'lettering' and 'type' will pretty much have the same output.

<strong>Note:</strong> I changed the Projects page to Articles so I didn't confuse you. The actual Projects page will have personal projects that I've created or co-created. Such as a product or another website.
