Text: Are you planning to pull all this content into a grid on the home page or something? Or how will these pages' content be seen?

Hiding pages is as simple as hiding the number in the front on your files. When you create a new page in the Panel, they are hidden by default. When you sort the pages in the Panel, and move a page up to the 'Visible' section, that's when a number is added to the front.

So if the below items were folders for your content,

01-page **is** visible
page is **not** visible

Make sense?

I'm curious to know where the content will be seen, though, if not on the project pages themselves, and I can help you further will how to pull that content in, if you need it.
