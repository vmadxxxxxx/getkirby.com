Text: Generally, when I do that, I just set up different installs as the folder structure for the content could get crazy. I think it'd also be relatively slow as it'd be pre-loading a lot of data.

All that said, I actually have a site where I'm running two different themes right now, granted the themes are mostly style - no deep functionality. 

In my case, it's just been a matter of organizing/separating the various assets, templates and snippets.
