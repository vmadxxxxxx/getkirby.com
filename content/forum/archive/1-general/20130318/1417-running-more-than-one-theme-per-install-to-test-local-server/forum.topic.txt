Text: Hi All, n00b here, with an easy question...
Is there a way to run several themes to test, on a local installation?
Just drop in more than one theme folder, for different sites?
Multiple sites on one install I guess is the question.

I can't wait to test the Styleguide, Knowledgebase, and Project Management themes!

Thanks,
