Text: The problem here is if people don't land on your home page and if you alter something that makes the CMS run, this could also affect your 'site down' page. 

Perhaps the easiest is just to add a temporary index.html 'site is down' page and also replace your .htaccess with a temporary one to route traffic to this index.html?

So then as along as you don't touch these files all will be good.
