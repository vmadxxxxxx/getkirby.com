Text: Hello!

I'm creating a gallery.

The template for my album displays all the files in the folder, unless it receives a `GET` variable (which switches the page into 'single item' mode), like this:

`mysite.com/gallery/album-name/?p=file.jpg`

My question is this: Can I add something to Kirby's .htaccess to allow me to use a URL like this:

`mysite.com/gallery/album-name/file.jpg`

Please forgive me if this is a silly question, To me .htaccess is strange voodoo indeed.

Many thanks,
