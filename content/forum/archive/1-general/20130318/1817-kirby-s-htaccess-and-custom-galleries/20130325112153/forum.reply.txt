Just an update to say that Bastian pointed out that Kirby does URL parameters that are much nicer than `_GET` variables. From his solution:

```
$image = param('image');

if($image) {
  // show the single image
} else {
 // show the entire gallery
}
```

You can then use the URL `/gallery/album-name/image:01.jpg`

Brilliant.
