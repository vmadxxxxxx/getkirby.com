Text: I'd love to be able to use Fancyzoom (http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html) with Kirby. I'm a total newbie. I've added the code to the template but can't figure out how to do this part of the instruction.

> Add onload="setupZoom()" inside your page's existing body tag.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
