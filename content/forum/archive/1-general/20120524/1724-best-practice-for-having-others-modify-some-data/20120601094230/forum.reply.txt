Text: @mikehargreaves if you got a server with ssh access and you are able to install the Dropbox client for Linux <https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx> it's actually super easy to link your content folder with your Dropbox. You could then share that folder with your team mates and administrate the content that way. That's actually a pretty awesome solution for that problem.
