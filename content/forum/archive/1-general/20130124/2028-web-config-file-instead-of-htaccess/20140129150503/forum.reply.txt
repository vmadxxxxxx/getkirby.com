Text: Hi Guys,

even though this thread is a bit old, I just wanted to contribute a working Web.Config file, since I just needed it for running Kirby on Windows Azure ;-)

See http://pastebin.com/eVicUuYp

What helped me was this little tip: http://blog.mdavies.net/2013/05/25/azure-websites-htaccess-rewrite-web-config/
-> IIS itself has a tool that converts the .htaccess rules into web.config rules. Quite handy. And worked like a charm!

Greetings
Alex
