Text: Love the search, even if I couldn't find the answer to my search query :). As the next feature, how about a way to mark questions as answered or topics as closed? That way people can focus on the 'active' questions. Also, notifications (email, twitter?) would be nice, so one gets informed when ones posts show activities. No pressure, baby steps, I know :)
