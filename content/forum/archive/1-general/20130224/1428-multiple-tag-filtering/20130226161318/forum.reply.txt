Text: The month and country cloud are a copy of the normal basic tagcloud and wrapped these in a dropdown-selectmenu combined with your alpha plugin.

So in the country dropdown-selectmenu I refer to the country-cloud-plugin and in the month cloud I refer to month-cloud-plugin.

In the plugins I adjusted the field and param to the corresponding fields, in this case country and month.

In the main-events page the queries from the select-boxes are filtered by:

filtered ->filterBy('country', urldecode(param('country')), ',')
and it will show all events of the selected country.

In the case of a selection by month it will be filtered by the selected month and show all the events of that month

->filterBy('month', urldecode(param('month')), ',')

See for the whole main-event page http://snipt.org/zfggh3
