Text: Hi, Thanks for having another look! :) 

I am not using any additional plugins, the only change i did was add the soundcloud function to my kirby.extended.php. (like it is in the same file linked above)


In my plugins folder there is only a folder "auth", and then that one file kirby.extended.php

or am i missing something?
