Text: I'm in the middle of a project where, however unlikely it might sound, the best way is to to a fresh install of GetKirby. Including install, design, blueprint, templates etc.

In my case, what I'm most concerned about are the images uploaded and used in each page using the ``( image: pic.png )``. The actual text is straight forward copy/paste but there are *alot* of images to be reuploaded.
