Text: This doesn't work in combination with URL-Keys.

Let's say we have a 'about-us' page in english and the URL-Key for the german version is 'ueber-uns'.

$pages->find('about-us')->content('de')->title();
doesn't work.

I have to do something like
$pages->find('ueber-uns')->content('de')->title();

But I only know the UID, not the url of the page. So I tried this (which didn't work):
$pages->findByUID('about-us')->content('de')->title();
