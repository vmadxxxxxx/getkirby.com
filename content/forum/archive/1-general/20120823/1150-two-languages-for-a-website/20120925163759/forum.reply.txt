Text: I currently have the same problem and solved it partly.

The language switch mentioned in https://gist.github.com/2835185 is not compatible with the URL-Key-Feature mentioned in http://getkirby.com/docs/multi-language/translating-urls

I solved this by using the UID of the page. But now I have a unnecessary redirect from /de/UID to /de/URL-Key
See https://gist.github.com/3782285

Is there a way to get the right URL for the same page but for a different language?
