Text: Is it possible, when calling the different article of a blog using the function:

`$articles = $pages->find('blog')->children()`

to order the pages using the fields of the different article? For instance, if I have a field <author>, would it be possible to display the article order by author name, alphabetically?

Thanks in advance. 


PS: I looked a bit in the forum and could not find a answer, but if there is already one, sorry for the duplication...
