Text: I've looked over various threads about this and I have followed them and the only way I can get the menu links to work is when it has the www.mysite.com/index.php/about from having `c::set('rewrite', false);` if I set it to true the links are dead.

The .htacess file is in the root directory and the install is in there also, so there are no subdirectories.

This is taking a great deal of time for me and I know it's just a silly mistake. Any help would be great, thank you.

I have uploaded the files on my live server also if this helps - http://sulcalibur.com and I'm running on a Mac with OSX Apache, not MAMP.

I'm using [this default](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/blob/master/.htaccess) .htaccess file and this is my [config.php file](https://gist.github.com/Sulcalibur/61a781120a4e822b5dd2).
