Text: I used the exact folder structure as you mentioned. But I might just try again to understand what is going on.

Yep, the carousel was clear done that works fine, using that kind of set up often.

I've tried my 'text and image problem' with Markdown Extra and that works out fine also. But that wraps extra paragraph-tags around my figure-tags, well no big deal I can use div instead.

edit: I see there are some threads about extra p-tags around figure so that might me solved ...
