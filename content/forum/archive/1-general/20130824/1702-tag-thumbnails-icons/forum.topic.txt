Text: I'm currently developing a portfolio website for a writer. For each article, we want to add tags, and display the tags on the index page. Instead of using text we're looking to display tag icons.

I know it's possible with Wordpress (http://wplift.com/how-to-show-different-icons-for-each-wordpress-category), but I don't know if I can make it happen with Kirby.

I was wondering if anybody would want to help me with the code.

Thanks in advance!
