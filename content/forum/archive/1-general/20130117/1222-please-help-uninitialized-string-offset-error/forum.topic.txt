Text: Hi! I am getting the following error at the top of my home page when I view it on the browser and I do not know what the problem is:

Notice: Uninitialized string offset: 0 in D:xampphtdocsbastiankirbylibvariables.php on line 27

I have not manipulated the contents of the 'kirby' folder (or the 'variables' php file) in any way.
