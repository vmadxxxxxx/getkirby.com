Text: Hi,
Still getting the hang of Kirby (on day three and still fascinated). I want to know how to add an image in my contents folder to my articles with Kirbytext and I didn't quite get it on the tutorials. If you can, please show me a practical example of code on both the template php file and the txt file. Thank you very much
