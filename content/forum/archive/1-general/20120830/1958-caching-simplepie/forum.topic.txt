Text: By default, simplepie requires a hard coded cache directory, which means it will have issues when pushing live. I looked at the tweets directory and it uses c::get('root.cache') to get the cache directory, but I can't seem to implement that in the simplepie plugin, so I probably have no clue what I'm doing.

How can I get my simplepie plugin to recognize what the cache directory is? Or at least to recognize what the root directory of the site is, so I can do a relative directory?
