Text: I've used Kirby before, but I haven't had this problem. I try to use the 
     <h1 class="title"><a href="<php? home() />">MyTitle</a></h1>
for my title link. But this time when i try click the link it results in a Redirect Loop.

The only difference from previous Kirby projects is that I am now using Mamp Pro, vs the free version of Mamp. 

I'm at a loss. Any help would be most appreciated!
