Text: On http://wallpapermonthly.com each article is generated by using a text file for information about the article and by fetching each images and its .txt metadata (e.g. title, author) that is contained in the same folder.

For the item, each image contained in the same folder will be displayed in a CDATA section with below some information about the picture. Simplified example :

	<description>
	<?php foreach($item->images() as $pic): ?>
	<![CDATA[
	<div>
	<img src="<?php echo $pic->url() ?>" />
	<p><?php echo $pic->title() ?> by <?php echo $pic->author() ?></p>
  	</div>
	]]>
	<?php endforeach ?>
  	</description>
