Text: Thanks, but that doesn't address my problem. I already have it set that way, and the formatted text shows up fine in the feed.

The problem is that the images are not referenced in the text field of the article. I use the template to show any images found with the article. But that code isn't in the feed snippet/template/plugin.

I think basically I need to edit the feed.php snippet to look for images and add them. I already tweaked it a little to address my link posts, which has a URL in a separate field in the Kirby post, it's just that messing with the feed snippet gets ugly fast, at least to me.

I was confused by the `$item->{$descriptionField}` call in the feed snippet, but now I see that just allows the user to have some control over which article field it uses. I think to accomplish what I want, I need to abandon that reference and use some template specific snippets to insert the HTML I want in the CDATA section.
