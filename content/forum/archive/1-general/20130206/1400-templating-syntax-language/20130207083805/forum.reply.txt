Text: True PHP might not be the prettiest, but I guess it also depends on how you write it ;-) 

Kirby has some very nice bits and using less PHP tags is always a good start, neater structured code is also good.

```php
if ($count > 10) {
   $number = "high";
  } else {
   $number = "low";
}
```

Can be written as:
```php
$number = $count > 10 ? 'high' : 'low';
```
  
And even these can get shorter if, for example, boolean:

```php
$is_admin = ($user['permissions'] == ‘admin’ ? true : false);
```
  
is equivalent to:
  
```php
$is_admin = $user['permissions'] == ‘admin’;
```
Because the '==' operator returns a boolean.

Functions, classes and some OOP are also available :-)
