Text: I thought that pages that are in the normal Kirby file system should be able to use the classes as they are loaded by the index.php and subsequent includes?

Are you trying to tie some external stuff into Kirby. It might be worth just writing some snippets to do the stuff you want and then including them on a normal Kirby page. If not just do the PHP separately.
