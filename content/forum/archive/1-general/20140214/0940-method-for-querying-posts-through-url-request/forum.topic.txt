Text: Hi,
I've set up a Category field in a 'Project' blueprint:

    categories:
        label: Categories
        type: multicheckbox
        options: 
          everybodys: Everybodys'
          ours: Ours
          clients: Clients
        size: small

Now I want to be able to request via a URL request all the projects linked to a specific category. Is there a standard way of querying KirbyCMS to return content based on custom fields? Something like:

    http://mysite.org/?categories=ours

Or does one need to build in such functionality? I'm guessing it needs to be built, but I thought I'd ask first.

Thanks in advance for the help.
