What we are currently doing to deal with categories is that we have categories added as a field to each Project in our content. Our content folder looks like this:

    content
      01-projects
        project1
        project2 
        project3

Then the content  file for project1 might be:

    Title: Project 1
    
    ----

    Text: Some text... 

    ----

    Categories: category1

    ----

    Tags: tag1

Then in our default template -- for the moment -- we pull all the projects by category, assuming a url like this: http://mysite.com/projects/ours:

    $category = $site->uri()->path()->last();
    if($category == 'projects'){
    	$category = '';
    }
    $projects = $pages->find('projects')->children();
    $found = $projects->filterBy('categories', $category);

Then we use $found to output the html content. 

The trouble is that we are also getting an "Error" in the title field, i.e. $page->title is Error. This is because there is no page in our content that corresponds to the url http://mysite.com/projects/ours. 

There are a number of ways around this. The easiest and messiest is just to create a folder "ours" under the projects directory. This solves the problem essentially, but it's messy. Another way would be to use .htacess to redirect requests with a base http://mysite.com/projects to home and then handle everything in the code, but then Kirby is in the dark about what page we are really on. The $page-title() call, for example, would be wrong, since we would not really be on the "Home" page.

The question is, though, how to intervene in what content kirby is pulling at a deeper more basic level, so that kirby knows fundamentally that we are searching for a category of pages. In WordPress, there is already the ability to pull up a set of posts by category, and then one can create a template for a category page. But what is the *best practices* sort of way to do this in Kirby. I'm unsatisfied with the solution of dropping an errant page into our Projects folder. 

If anyone has any ideas, I would be very very happy to hear them. I'm still new to Kirby.
