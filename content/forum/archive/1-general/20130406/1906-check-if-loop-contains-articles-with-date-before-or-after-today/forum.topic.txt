Text: Hi everyone,

I'm still trying to get the hang of PHP and I'm a little stuck on something.

I'm building an event list for my client and I want to show two separate lists: One with future dates and one with past dates.

My articles (events) are in a folder called 'calendar' and the have a date field.

This is the start of my loop
     $tourdates = $pages->find('calendar')->children()->visible()->sortBy("date", "asc");
     foreach($tourdates as $tourdate)

I can check if a date is in the future or in the past within the loop, but I need to check if the loop contains articles with future dates before I run through it so I can show a substitute text if there are no future dates.

Does anybody have an idea how to do this?

Thanks!
