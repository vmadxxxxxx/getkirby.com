Text: Thanks Russ. I fixed it as follows:

    $today = date('Yz'); // 201359
    $futuredates = array(); // create empty array
    $pastdates = array(); // create empty array
    
    foreach($tourdates as $tourdate):   
    $date = $tourdate->date('Yz'); 
    
    if($date >= $today): // check if date is today or in the future
    $futuredates[] = $tourdate; // add this article to $futuredates
    else:
    $pastdates[] = $tourdate; // if date is in the past add it to $pastdates		
    endif;
    
    endforeach;

Then I check if the arrays are empty and display code accordingly.

What do you think? I'm fairly new to PHP, finding the right way to deal with situations is not easy :-)
