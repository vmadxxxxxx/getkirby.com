So I created my own...not sure what to call it...tag? Like this:

    Title: Portfolio Item 3
    ----
    Gig: Freelance
    ----
    Text: [...]

And in my portfolio.php file, I put `A <?php echo kirbytext($page->gig()) ?> gig`. This obviously didn't have the results I wanted.

Is there a way to output the Gig text without the `<p>` tag? Or, is there another solution to the problem?

Thanks.
