Text: Thanks Tillpro, that part worked. I don't get errors regarding the .htaccess file. My config.php file works with "rewrite, true" now.
 
However, I'm still not seeing the .jpgs I'm placing into any of the content folders.

I'm following the docs/media section, which is a no brainer but for whatever reason it's not working.

I can put .jpg's url in the folder's text file and it shows up but that's kinda kills the whole point of the kirby cms.

hm.
