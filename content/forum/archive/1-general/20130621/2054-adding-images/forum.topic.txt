Text: Hi, I'm new to Kirby. Currently having a couple problems... 

I put Kirby on my ftp in a subfolder of my domain and everything seems to work except for when I try to add media to a page.  I've tried different image sizes, naming, and placing them in different folders (trying to add .jpgs in the "home" folder).  They're not showing up anywhere.

Also, I've disabled "mod_rewrite" but do have a .htaccess file on my ftp. I've had trouble with "mod_rewrite" enabled where pages other than "home" not showing up. Not sure what to do with the .htaccess file.  Don't see "RewriteBase" in there, only this:

RewriteEngine on 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT,L]
RewriteRule ^(.+) index.php

Thanks for the help and forgive my noobness.
