Text: Thanks for the input. I'm using a radio button for the field:

  published:
    label: Visibility
    type: radio
    default: published
    options:
      published: Published
      draft: Draft

@russbaldwin I am using the panel to edit content, I took a look at some files and they seem to be ok. I tried using your snippet with the actual names of my keys/vals, but it seems to come up empty when it should have at least a few results: 

     $privatePage = $pages->visible()->filterBy('published', 'draft');

And then var_dump($privatePage) gives this:

     object(pages)#4646 (4) { ["index"]=> array(0) { } ["pagination"]=> NULL ["active"]=> bool(false) ["_"]=> array(0) { } }
