Text: @eytanbiala, not sure what you are after but the following works for me?
I've added a visible because I have a lot of stuff in my test site. You might also want to use a boolean for the 'private' indication so you can use a check box in panel?

```php

<?php
// Get the filterd array of pages
// You probably wan to check to see if it is empty before doing anything with it
$privatePage = $pages->visible()->filterBy('mykey', 'private');
?>

<!-- This echoes out the titles of the private pages -->
<ul>
<?php foreach($privatePage as $item): ?>         
<li><?php echo $item->title() ?></li>      
<?php endforeach ?>    
</ul>
```

If this doesn't work, check for capitalised `Mykey` in you txt files and spacing and layout.

```html
Title: Page Title

----

Mykey: private

----

Text: Blah, Blah

```

@dokdeleon, you can create extra fields in your [txt content files](http://getkirby.com/docs/content) and add them to your [Blueprints](http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints), it's all in the [docs](http://getkirby.com/docs) ;-)
