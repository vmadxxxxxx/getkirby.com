Text: Is there a way to get a page's numeric ID number out of the $page object? For example, if I have five pages, those pages' corresponding IDs would be:

0
1
2
3
4

This would be helpful in cases when I have, say, a list of projects on a portfolio site, and on each project page I want to be able to generate something like "Project number x of 100".

I have already looked in [the reference](http://reference.new.getkirby.com/cms/classes/page) and don't see a method that does this.  I am *not* looking for [the uid() value](http://reference.new.getkirby.com/cms/classes/page/methods/uid), which may not strictly be sequential integers starting at zero.  For example, my UIDs could be:

100
200
300
350
400

…but all I want are simple IDs like:

0
1
2
3
4
5

Thanks!
