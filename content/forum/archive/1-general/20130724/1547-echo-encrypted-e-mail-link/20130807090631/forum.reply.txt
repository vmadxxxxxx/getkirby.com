Text: What do you mean by 'encrypted'?
Do you mean encode the address into HTML entities for spam prevention?
(Such as http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html)

If you just mean generating a mailto: link that's rather simple:

	<a href="mailto:<?php echo $page->email(); ?>"> <?php echo $page->email(); ?></a>
