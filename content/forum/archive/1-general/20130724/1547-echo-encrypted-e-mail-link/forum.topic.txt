Text: Assuming that I have an e-mail address in my text file like so:

	Email: hello@example.com

Is there a way I can echo an encrypted e-mail link directly in the code, in the same pattern that is used for e.g. YouTube or Vimeo links?

	<?php echo email($about->email()) ?>

I'm creating a list of contact links in the footer and I want to avoid using the kirbytext method, because it wraps the link in `p` tags.
