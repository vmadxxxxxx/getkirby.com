Text: Hello,

I'm a bit stumped trying to figure out how to display articles from subfolders. My folder structure looks like this:

Folder
-2014
--01-Article
--02-Article

I am able to list the the year folder, but unable to display 01-Article and 02-Article. I am using the blog tutorial to set this up.

Ultimately I have been able to create a listing using the submenu tutorial, but I would like to include excerpts and dates in the listing. Any help would definitely be appreciated.
