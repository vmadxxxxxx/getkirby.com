Text: Mh `$count = 1` doesn't solve it.

I am not displaying every article on the first page - I am already on a subpage and now want the link to the previous and next **sibling**


     parent
       child1
       child2 <- lets say this one is open
       child3

Now on child2 there should be a link to child3 and child1...
