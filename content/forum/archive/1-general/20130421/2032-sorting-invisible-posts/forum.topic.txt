Text: I'm working on moving a project into Kirby that resembles a book in that there are "Chapters" instead of blog posts or pages. At the end of each chapter I offer a link to the next. If it's the last chapter that's been posted I instead offer a "Coming soon — Chapter 6: Chapter Name" text. I ma have multiple invisible chapters sitting in the directory, so I'd like to know:

Is there a way to sort the invisible directories and grab just the first one returned?
