Text: I don't think it is a brilliant idea to have code in your text files and I would want to add the image to a content page folder if I could?

Having said that it could be possible with embedded PHP
```html
<ul>
<li>
  <img src="
    <?php echo url('assets/images/foo.png') ?>
  "/>
lorem
</li>
</ul>
``` 
Another better option might be to set a site variable in your sites text file or perhaps one in you config so you can call it later?
