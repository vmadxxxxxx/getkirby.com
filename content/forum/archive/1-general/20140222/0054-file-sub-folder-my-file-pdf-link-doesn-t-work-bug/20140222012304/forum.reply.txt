Text: Ok, here's a quirk. But this solution really sucks for end-users I think..

(file: my/folder/the file.pdf  won't work.

But (file: content/04-my/folder/the file.pdf works.

However, why does (file: the file.pdf work when the file is located in the same folder as the page the link is located at??
