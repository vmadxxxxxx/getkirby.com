Text: Hello there,

That is possible using PHP function ["filemtime"](http://ch2.php.net/filemtime) which takes in as a parameter the path to the file and returns either a Unix timestamp or FALSE in case of failure.

So in your template you could actually do something like:

    php echo date('date format', filemtime('path to the file'));
