Text: For a site I'm making, there's a page that lists all its subpages. The subpages are not linked, and their content is displayed in that parent.

I'd like to put an ID attribute to each item of that list. I was using `$page->uid();` and it was working, I could access `site/parentpage#subpage-item1`, `site/parentpage#subpage-item2` and so on.

There's a problem though : that uid isn't localized. If my website is by default in French, with urls like this `site/fr/frenchparentpage#frenchsubpage-item1`, the UID stays the same and I get this `site/en/englishparentpage#frenchsubpage-item1`.

Now the url() object gives me a right path : `site/en/englishparentpage/englishsubpage-item1`, but that's not how I want my site to behave.

How could I get the last bit of the url() object, to be able to use `site/en/englishparentpage#englishsubpage-item1` ?
