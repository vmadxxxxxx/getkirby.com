Text: I had the same question some days ago, and answered it myself with using just plain PHP:

	<?
	
	// split the subpage's url on every slash 
	$url = explode("/", $subpage->url());
	// take the last part of the url
	$uid = $url[count($url) - 1];
	
	// your uid
	echo $uid;
	
	?>

Just put this in your `foreach()`-loop and everything should work well. I haven't tried it on a multi-lang site, but as you said the URL-method works well, this snippet should work well, too :)
