Text: Hey all—

I'm building a responsive site at the moment and there's a section where I want to serve up different content (snippet) in a template only for smartphones. Is there a way to call a snippet by php media query?

    <?php snippet(($page->template() == '@media only screen and (max-width: 479px)' ? 'projects-phone'))?> 

I know this is nothing like it, but just jotting an idea out...and help would be great.
