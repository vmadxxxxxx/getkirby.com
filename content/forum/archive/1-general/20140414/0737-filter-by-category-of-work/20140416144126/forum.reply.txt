Text: $pages->filterBy($key, $value, $split=false)
filters a set of pages by a key and a value.
if you pass a splitting character as third arg. 
it will try to split a single value. ie. a comma 
sperated list of tags and search within its 
elements. returns the filtered set of pages



so you can set a variable "Category: Web" and filter it this way.
