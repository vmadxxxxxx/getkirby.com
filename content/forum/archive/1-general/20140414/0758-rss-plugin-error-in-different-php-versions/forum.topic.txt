Text: Hi,
I've got the following error when changing to different PHP versions in MAMP:

Version 5.3.28 anything is fine...

Version 5.4.26
I've got the following when clicking on the RSS link (no big deal though): 

Allowed memory size of 262144 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 3072 bytes) in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/test

The biggest Problem is Version 5.5.10
Deprecated: preg_replace(): The /e modifier is deprecated, use preg_replace_callback instead in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/test/kirby/lib/kirby.php on line 2597

Well, I'm not a PHP pro, just guessing that a function which is used should be replaced with a newer one?

Nevermind, found the answer in the comment section...
